# What is MQTT?

> "With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded. All we need to do is make sure we keep
> talking."
>
> — Stephen Hawking

MQTT is a publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol used in the internet of Things. It works on top of the TCP/IP
protocol, and is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the
network bandwidth is limited. The goal is to provide a protocol, which is bandwidth-efficient and uses little battery
power.

The [previous tutorial](iot-agent.md) used HTTP as its transport mechanism between the devices and the IoT Agent. HTTP
uses a request/response paradigm where each device connects directly to the IoT Agent. MQTT is different in that
publish-subscribe is event-driven and pushes messages to clients. It requires an additional central communication point
(known as the MQTT broker) which it is in charge of dispatching all messages between the senders and the rightful
receivers. Each client that publishes a message to the broker, includes a **topic** into the message. The **topic** is
the routing information for the broker. Each client that wants to receive messages subscribes to a certain **topic** and
the broker delivers all messages with the matching **topic** to the client. Therefore the clients don’t have to know
each other, they only communicate over the **topic**. This architecture enables highly scalable solutions without
dependencies between the data producers and the data consumers.

A summary of the differences between the two transport protocols can be seen below:

| HTTP Transport                                                                      | MQTT Transport                                                                                |

| Higher Power Requirement                                                            | Low Power Requirement                                                                         |

The UltraLight 2.0 IoT Agent will only send or interpret messages using the
[UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
syntax, however it can be used to send and receive messages over multiple **transport** mechanisms. Therefore we are
able to use the same FIWARE generic enabler to connect to a wider range of IoT devices.

<h4>Mosquitto MQTT Broker</h4>

[Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is a readily available, open source MQTT broker which will be used during this
tutorial. It is available licensed under EPL/EDL. More information can be found at `https://mosquitto.org/`

<h4>Device Monitor</h4>

For the purpose of this tutorial, a series of dummy IoT devices have been created, which will be attached to the context
broker. Details of the architecture and protocol used can be found in the [IoT Sensors tutorial](iot-sensors.md) The
state of each device can be seen on the UltraLight device monitor web page found at:
`http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

# Architecture

This application builds on the components created in [previous tutorials](iot-agent.md). It will make use of two FIWARE
components - the [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the
[IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Usage of the Orion Context Broker
(with proper context data flowing through it) is sufficient for an application to qualify as _“Powered by FIWARE”_. Both
the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on open source [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep
persistence of the information they hold. We will also be using the dummy IoT devices created in the
[previous tutorial](iot-agent.md) Additionally we will add an instance of the [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) MQTT
broker which is open source and available under the EPL/EDL.

Therefore the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   The FIWARE [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
-   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will:
    -   receive southbound requests using [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) and convert
        them to
        [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
        MQTT topics for the MQTT Broker
    -   listen to the **MQTT Broker** on registered topics to send measurements northbound
-   The [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) **MQTT Broker** which acts as a central communication point, passing MQTT
    topics between the **IoT Agent** and IoT devices as necessary.
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations
    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys
-   A webserver acting as set of [dummy IoT devices](iot-sensors.md) using the
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    protocol running over MQTT.
-   The **Context Provider NGSI** proxy is not used in this tutorial. It does the following:
    -   receive requests using [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
    -   makes requests to publicly available data sources using their own APIs in a proprietary format
    -   returns context data back to the Orion Context Broker in
        [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) format.
-   The **Stock Management Frontend** is not used in this tutorial will it does the following:
    -   Display store information
    -   Show which products can be bought at each store
    -   Allow users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP or MQTT requests over TCP, the entities can be
containerized and run from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-over-MQTT/img/architecture.png)

The necessary configuration information for wiring up the Mosquitto MQTT Broker, the IoT devices and the IoT Agent can
be seen in the services section of the associated `docker-compose.yml` file:

<h3>Mosquitto Configuration</h3>

```yaml
mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto
    hostname: mosquitto
    container_name: mosquitto
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "1883"
        - "9001"
    ports:
        - "1883:1883"
        - "9001:9001"
    volumes:
        - ./mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
```

The `mosquitto` container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `1883` is exposed so we can post MQTT topics
-   Port `9001` is the standard port for HTTP/Websocket communications

The attached volume is a
[configuration file](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-over-MQTT/blob/master/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf) used to
increase the debug level of the MQTT Message Broker.

<h3>Dummy IoT Devices Configuration</h3>

```yaml
tutorial:
    image: fiware/tutorials.context-provider
    hostname: iot-sensors
    container_name: fiware-tutorial
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "3000"
        - "3001"
    ports:
        - "3000:3000"
        - "3001:3001"
    environment:
        - "DEBUG=tutorial:*"
        - "WEB_APP_PORT=3000"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_PORT=3001"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_API_KEY=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_TRANSPORT=MQTT"
```

The `tutorial` container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `3000` is exposed so we can see the web page displaying the Dummy IoT devices.
-   Port `3001` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can make UltraLight commands without
    being part of the same network.

The `tutorial` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                     | Value                        | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEBUG                   | `tutorial:*`                 | Debug flag used for logging                                                                                                               |
| WEB_APP_PORT            | `3000`                       | Port used by web-app which displays the dummy device data                                                                                 |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_PORT      | `3001`                       | Port used by the dummy IoT devices to receive commands                                                                                    |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_API_KEY   | `4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov` | Random security key used for UltraLight interactions - used to ensure the integrity of interactions between the devices and the IoT Agent |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_TRANSPORT | `MQTT`                       | The transport protocol used by the dummy IoT devices                                                                                      |

The other `tutorial` container configuration values described in the YAML file are not used in this tutorial.

<h3>IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0 Configuration</h3>

The [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be instantiated within a
Docker container. An official Docker image is available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/iotagent-ul/)
tagged `fiware/iotagent-ul`. The necessary configuration can be seen below:

```yaml
iot-agent:
    image: fiware/iotagent-ul:latest
    hostname: iot-agent
    container_name: fiware-iot-agent
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "4041"
    ports:
        - "4041:4041"
    environment:
        - IOTA_CB_HOST=orion
        - IOTA_CB_PORT=1026
        - IOTA_NORTH_PORT=4041
        - IOTA_REGISTRY_TYPE=mongodb
        - IOTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
        - IOTA_TIMESTAMP=true
        - IOTA_CB_NGSI_VERSION=v2
        - IOTA_AUTOCAST=true
        - IOTA_MONGO_HOST=mongo-db
        - IOTA_MONGO_PORT=27017
        - IOTA_MONGO_DB=iotagentul
        - IOTA_PROVIDER_URL=http://iot-agent:4041
        - IOTA_MQTT_HOST=mosquitto
        - IOTA_MQTT_PORT=1883
```

The `iot-agent` container relies on the presence of the Orion Context Broker and uses a MongoDB database to hold device
information such as device URLs and Keys. The container is listening on a single port:

-   Port `4041` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can make provisioning commands without
    being part of the same network.

The `iot-agent` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                  | Value                   | Description                                                                                                                                           |

| IOTA_TIMESTAMP       | `true`                  | Whether to supply timestamp information with each measurement received from attached devices                                                          |
| IOTA_CB_NGSI_VERSION | `v2`                    | Whether to supply use NGSI v2 when sending updates for active attributes                                                                              |

As you can see, use of the MQTT transport is driven by only two environment variables `IOTA_MQTT_HOST` and
`IOTA_MQTT_PORT`

# Provisioning an IoT Agent (UltraLight over MQTT)

To follow the tutorial correctly please ensure you have the device monitor page available in your browser and click on
the page to enable audio before you enter any cUrl commands. The device monitor displays the current state of an array
of dummy devices using Ultralight 2.0 syntax

<h4>Device Monitor</h4>
The device monitor can be found at: `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

## Checking Mosquitto Health

We will start by mimicking the roles of both the IoT Agent and a dummy IoT device and send and receive some messages
using MQTT. This section of the tutorial requires several open terminals.

### Start an MQTT Subscriber (1st Terminal)

Eventually once we have wired by the system correctly, IoT Agent will subscribe to all relevant events to listen for
northbound traffic in the form of sensor measurements. It therefore will need to make a subscription across all topics.
Similarly an actuator must subscribe to a single topic to receive events which effect itself when commands are sent
southbound. To check that the lines of communication are open, we can subscribe to a given topic, and see that we are
able to receive something when a message is published.

Open a **new terminal**, and create a new running `mqtt-subscriber` Docker container as follows:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name mqtt-subscriber \
  --network fiware_default efrecon/mqtt-client sub -h mosquitto -t "/#"
```

The terminal will then be ready to receive events

### Start an MQTT Publisher (2nd Terminal)

A sensor sending northbound measurements will publish to those measurements to the MQTT Broker to be passed on to any
subscriber than wants them. The sensor will not need to make a connection to the subscriber directly.

Open a **new terminal**, and run a `mqtt-publisher` Docker container to send a message as follows:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name mqtt-publisher \
  --network fiware_default efrecon/mqtt-client pub -h mosquitto -m "HELLO WORLD" -t "/test"
```

#### 1st terminal - Result:

If the MQTT Broker is functioning correctly, the message should be received in the other terminal

```text
HELLO WORLD
```

### Stop an MQTT Subscriber (1st Terminal)

To terminate the MQTT subscriber, run the following Docker command:

```bash
docker stop mqtt-subscriber
```

### Show Mosquitto Log

To show that the communication occurred via the **MQTT Broker**, we can inspect the log of the `mosquitto` Docker
container as shown:

```bash
docker logs --tail 10 mosquitto
```

#### Result:

```text
1529661883: New client connected from 172.18.0.5 as mqttjs_8761e518 (c1, k0).
1529662472: New connection from 172.18.0.7 on port 1883.

## Checking the IoT Agent Service Health

You can check if the IoT Agent is running by making an HTTP request to the exposed port:

#### 1 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/about'
```

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "libVersion": "2.6.0-next",
    "port": "4041",
    "baseRoot": "/",
    "version": "1.6.0-next"
}
```

> **What if I get a `Failed to connect to localhost port 4041: Connection refused` Response?**
>
> If you get a `Connection refused` response, the IoT Agent cannot be found where expected for this tutorial - you will
> need to substitute the URL and port in each cUrl command with the corrected IP address. All the cUrl commands tutorial
> assume that the IoT Agent is available on `localhost:4041`.
>
> Try the following remedies:
>
> -   To check that the docker containers are running try the following:
>
> ```
> docker ps

>
> You should see four containers running. If the IoT Agent is not running, you can restart the containers as necessary.

> curl -X GET \
>  'http://$(docker-machine ip default):4041/version'
> ```
>
> Alternatively run all your curl commands from within the container network:
>
> ```

>  -X GET 'http://iot-agent:4041/iot/about'
> ```

## Connecting IoT Devices

The IoT Agent acts as a middleware between the IoT devices and the context broker. It therefore needs to be able to
create context data entities with unique IDs. Once a service has been provisioned and an unknown device makes a
measurement the IoT Agent add this to the context using the supplied `<device-id>` (unless the device is recognized and
can be mapped to a known ID.

There is no guarantee that every supplied IoT device `<device-id>` will always be unique, therefore all provisioning
requests to the IoT Agent require two mandatory headers:

-   `fiware-service` header is defined so that entities for a given service can be held in a separate mongoDB database.
-   `fiware-servicepath` can be used to differentiate between arrays of devices.

For example within a smart city application you would expect different `fiware-service` headers for different
departments (e.g. parks, transport, refuse collection etc.) and each `fiware-servicepath` would refer to specific park
and so on. This would mean that data and devices for each service can be identified and separated as needed, but the
data would not be siloed - for example data from a **Smart Bin** within a park can be combined with the **GPS Unit** of
a refuse truck to alter the route of the truck in an efficient manner.

The **Smart Bin** and **GPS Unit** are likely to come from different manufacturers and it cannot be guaranteed that
there is no overlap within `<device-id>`s used. The use of the `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers can
ensure that this is always the case, and allows the context broker to identify the original source of the context data.

### Provisioning a Service Group for MQTT

Invoking group provision is always the first step in connecting devices. For MQTT communication, provisioning supplies
the authentication key so the IoT Agent will know which **topic** it must subscribe to.

It is possible to set up default commands and attributes for all devices as well, but this is not done within this
tutorial as we will be provisioning each device separately.

This example provisions an anonymous group of devices. It tells the IoT Agent that a series of devices will be
communicating by sending messages to the `/4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov` **topic**

The `resource` attribute is left blank since HTTP communication is not being used.

The URL location of `cbroker` is an optional attribute - if it is not provided, the IoT Agent uses the default context
broker URL as defined in the configuration file, however it has been added here for completeness.

#### 2 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "services": [
   {
     "apikey":      "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
     "cbroker":     "http://orion:1026",
     "entity_type": "Thing",
     "resource":    ""
   }
 ]
}'
```

### Provisioning a Sensor

It is common good practice to use URNs following the NGSI-LD
[specification](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.01.01_60/gs_CIM009v010101p.pdf) when creating
entities. Furthermore it is easier to understand meaningful names when defining data attributes. These mappings can be
defined by provisioning a device individually.

Three types of measurement attributes can be provisioned:

-   `attributes` are active readings from the device
-   `lazy` attributes are only sent on request - The IoT Agent will inform the device to return the measurement
-   `static_attributes` are as the name suggests static data about the device (such as relationships) passed on to the
    context broker.

> **Note**: in the case where individual `id`s are not required, or aggregated data is sufficient the `attributes` can
> be defined within the provisioning service rather than individually.

#### 3 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "devices": [
   {
     "device_id":   "motion001",
     "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001",
     "entity_type": "Motion",
     "protocol":    "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
     "transport":   "MQTT",
     "timezone":    "Europe/Berlin",
     "attributes": [
       { "object_id": "c", "name": "count", "type": "Integer" }
     ],
     "static_attributes": [
       { "name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship", "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
     ]
   }
 ]
}
'
```

In the request we are associating the device `motion001` with the URN `urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001` and mapping the device
reading `c` with the context attribute `count` (which is defined as an `Integer`) A `refStore` is defined as a
`static_attribute`, placing the device within **Store** `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`.

The addition of the `transport=MQTT` attribute in the body of the request is sufficient to tell the IoT Agent that it
should subscribe to the `/<api-key>/<device-id>` **topic** to receive measurements.

You can simulate a dummy IoT device measurement coming from the **Motion Sensor** device `motion001`, by posting an MQTT
message to the following **topic**

#### 4 MQTT Request:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name mqtt-publisher --network \
  fiware_default efrecon/mqtt-client pub -h mosquitto -m "c|1" \
  -t "/4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov/motion001/attrs"
```

-   The value of the `-m` parameter defines the message. This is in UltraLight syntax.
-   The value of the `-t` parameter defines the **topic**.

The **topic** must be in the following form:

```text
/<api-key>/<device-id>/attrs
```

> **Note** In the [previous tutorial](iot-agent.md), when testing HTTP connectivity between the Motion Sensor and an IoT
> Agent, a similar dummy HTTP request was sent to update the `count` value. This time the IoT Agent is configured to
> listen to MQTT topics, and we need to post a dummy message to an MQTT topic.

When running using the MQTT transport protocol, the IoT Agent is subscribing to the MQTT **topics** and the device
monitor will be configured to display all MQTT **messages** sent to each **topic** - effectively it is showing the list
messages received and sent by Mosquitto.

With the IoT Agent connected via MQTT, the service group has defined the **topic** which the agent is subscribed to.
Since the api-key matches the root of the **topic**, the MQTT message from the **Motion Sensor** is passed to the IoT
Agent which has previously subscribed.

Because we have specifically provisioned the device (`motion001`) - the IoT Agent is able to map attributes before
raising a request with the Orion Context Broker.

You can see that a measurement has been recorded, by retrieving the entity data from the context broker. Don't forget to
add the `fiware-service` and `fiware-service-path` headers.

#### 5 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001' \
  -d 'type=Motion' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001",
    "type": "Motion",
    "TimeInstant": {
        "type": "ISO8601",
        "value": "2018-05-25T10:51:32.00Z",
        "metadata": {}
    },
    "count": {
        "type": "Integer",
        "value": "1",
        "metadata": {
            "TimeInstant": {
                "type": "ISO8601",
                "value": "2018-05-25T10:51:32.646Z"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The response shows that the **Motion Sensor** device with `id=motion001` has been successfully identified by the IoT
Agent and mapped to the entity `id=urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001`. This new entity has been created within the context data.
The `c` attribute from the dummy device measurement request has been mapped to the more meaningful `count` attribute
within the context. As you will notice, a `TimeInstant` attribute has been added to both the entity and the metadata of
the attribute - this represents the last time the entity and attribute have been updated, and is automatically added to
each new entity because the `IOTA_TIMESTAMP` environment variable was set when the IoT Agent was started up.

### Provisioning an Actuator

Provisioning an actuator is similar to provisioning a sensor. The `transport=MQTT` attribute defines the communications
protocol to be used. For MQTT communications, the `endpoint` attribute is not required as there is no HTTP URL where the
device is listening for commands. The array of commands is mapped to directly to messages sent to the
`/<api-key>/<device-id>/cmd` **topic** The `commands` array includes a list of each command that can be invoked.

The example below provisions a bell with the `deviceId=bell001`.

#### 6 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "bell001",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
      "entity_type": "Bell",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "MQTT",
      "commands": [
        { "name": "ring", "type": "command" }
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

Before we wire-up the context broker, we can test that a command can be send to a device by making a REST request
directly to the IoT Agent's North Port using the `/v2/op/update` endpoint. It is this endpoint that will eventually be
invoked by the context broker once we have connected it up. To test the configuration you can run the command directly
as shown below.

Note that the Context Broker command remains exactly the same regardless of the **transport** being used to communicate
with the actual IoT device.

#### 7 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  http://localhost:4041/v2/op/update \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
    "actionType": "update",
    "entities": [
        {
            "type": "Bell",
            "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
            "ring" : {
                "type": "command",
                "value": ""
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can also see the state of the bell change.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-over-MQTT/img/bell-ring.gif)

The result of the command to ring the bell can be read by querying the entity within the Orion Context Broker.

#### 8 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001' \
  -d 'type=Bell' \
  -d 'options=keyValues' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
    "type": "Bell",
    "TimeInstant": "2018-05-25T20:06:28.00Z",
    "refStore": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001",
    "ring_info": " ring OK",
    "ring_status": "OK",
    "ring": ""
}
```

The `TimeInstant` shows last the time any command associated with the entity has been invoked. The result of `ring`
command can be seen in the value of the `ring_info` attribute.

### Provisioning a Smart Door

Provisioning a device which offers both commands and measurements is merely a matter of making an HTTP POST request with
both `attributes` and `command` attributes in the body of the request. Once again the `transport=MQTT` attribute defines
the communications protocol to be used, and no `endpoint` attribute is required as there is no HTTP URL where the device
is listening for commands.

#### 9 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "door001",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Door:001",
      "entity_type": "Door",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "MQTT",
      "commands": [
        {"name": "unlock","type": "command"},
        {"name": "open","type": "command"},

        {"name": "lock","type": "command"}
       ],
       "attributes": [
        {"object_id": "s", "name": "state", "type":"Text"}
       ],
       "static_attributes": [

       ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

### Provisioning a Smart Lamp

Similarly, a **Smart Lamp** with two commands (`on` and `off`) and two attributes can be provisioned as follows:

#### 10 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "lamp001",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Lamp:001",
      "entity_type": "Lamp",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "MQTT",
      "commands": [
        {"name": "on","type": "command"},
        {"name": "off","type": "command"}
       ],
       "attributes": [
        {"object_id": "s", "name": "state", "type":"Text"},
        {"object_id": "l", "name": "luminosity", "type":"Integer"}
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

The full list of provisioned devices can be obtained by making a GET request to the `/iot/devices` endpoint.

#### 11 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

## Enabling Context Broker Commands

Having connected up the IoT Agent to the IoT devices, the Orion Context Broker was informed that the commands are now
available. In other words the IoT Agent registered itself as a [Context Provider](context-providers.md) for the command
attributes.

Once the commands have been registered it will be possible to ring the **Bell**, open and close the **Smart Door** and
switch the **Smart Lamp** on and off by sending requests to the Orion Context Broker, rather than sending UltraLight 2.0
requests directly the IoT devices as we did in the [previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md)

All the communications leaving and arriving at the North port of the IoT Agent use the standard NGSI syntax. The
transport protocol used between the IoT devices and the IoT Agent is irrelevant to this layer of communication.
Effectively the IoT Agent is offering a simplified facade pattern of well-known endpoints to actuate any device.

Therefore this section of registering and invoking commands **duplicates** the instructions found in the
[previous tutorial](iot-agent.md)

### Ringing the Bell

To invoke the `ring` command, the `ring` attribute must be updated in the context.

#### 12 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001/attrs' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "ring": {
      "type" : "command",
      "value" : ""
  }
}'
```

If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can also see the state of the bell change.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-over-MQTT/img/bell-ring.gif)

### Opening the Smart Door

To invoke the `open` command, the `open` attribute must be updated in the context.

#### 13 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Door:001/attrs' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "open": {
      "type" : "command",
      "value" : ""
  }
}'
```

### Switching on the Smart Lamp

To switch on the **Smart Lamp**, the `on` attribute must be updated in the context.

#### 14 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Lamp:001/attrs' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "on": {
      "type" : "command",
      "value" : ""
  }
}'
```
