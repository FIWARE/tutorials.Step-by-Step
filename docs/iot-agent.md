**Description:** This tutorial introduces the concept of an **IoT Agent** and wires up the dummy
[UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual) IoT
devices created in the [previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md) so that measurements can be read and commands can be sent
using [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) requests sent to the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as

# What is an IoT Agent?

> "In every operation there is an above the line and a below the line. Above the line is what you do by the book. Below
> the line is how you do the job."
>
> — John le Carré (A Perfect Spy)

An IoT Agent is a component that lets a group of devices send their data to and be managed from a Context Broker using
their own native protocols. IoT Agents should also be able to deal with security aspects of the FIWARE platform
(authentication and authorization of the channel) and provide other common services to the device programmer.

The Orion Context Broker exclusively uses [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) requests for
all of its interactions. Each IoT Agent provides a **North Port**
[NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) interface which is used for context broker interactions
and all interactions beneath this port occur using the **native protocol** of the attached devices.

In effect, this brings a standard interface to all IoT interactions at the context information management level. Each
group of IoT devices are able to use their own proprietary protocols and disparate transport mechanisms under the hood
whilst the associated IoT Agent offers a facade pattern to handle this complexity.

IoT Agents already exist or are in development for many IoT communication protocols and data models. Examples include
the following:

-   [IoTAgent-JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - a bridge between HTTP/MQTT messaging (with
    a JSON payload) and NGSI
-   [IoTAgent-LWM2M](https://fiware-iotagent-lwm2m.readthedocs.io/en/latest) - a bridge between the
    [Lightweight M2M](https://www.omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/) protocol and NGSI
-   [IoTAgent-UL](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest) - a bridge between HTTP/MQTT messaging (with an
    UltraLight2.0 payload) and NGSI
-   [IoTagent-LoRaWAN](https://fiware-lorawan.readthedocs.io/en/latest) - a bridge between the
    [LoRaWAN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/) protocol and NGSI

## Southbound Traffic (Commands)

HTTP requests generated by the Orion Context Broker and passed downwards towards an IoT device (via an IoT agent) are
known as southbound traffic. Southbound traffic consists of **commands** made to actuator devices which alter the state
of the real world by their actions.

For example to switch on a real-life UltraLight 2.0 **Smart Lamp** the following interactions would occur:

1.  An NGSI PATCH request is sent to the **Context broker** to update the current context of **Smart Lamp**

-   this is effectively an indirect request invoke the `on` command of the **Smart Lamp**

2.  The **Context Broker** finds the entity within the context and notes that the context provision for this attribute
    has been delegated to the IoT Agent
3.  The **Context broker** sends an NGSI request to the North Port of the **IoT Agent** to invoke the command
4.  The **IoT Agent** receives this Southbound request and converts it to UltraLight 2.0 syntax and passes it on to the
    **Smart Lamp**
5.  The **Smart Lamp** switches on the lamp and returns the result of the command to the **IoT Agent** in UltraLight 2.0
    syntax
6.  The **IoT Agent** receives this Northbound request, interprets it and passes the result of the interaction into the
    context by making an NGSI request to the **Context Broker**.
7.  The **Context Broker** receives this Northbound request and updates the context with the result of the command.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent/img/command-swimlane.png)

-   Requests between **User** and **Context Broker** use NGSI
-   Requests between **Context Broker** and **IoT Agent** use NGSI
-   Requests between **IoT Agent** and **IoT Device** use native protocols
-   Requests between **IoT Device** and **IoT Agent** use native protocols
-   Requests between **IoT Agent** and **Context Broker** use NGSI

## Northbound Traffic (Measurements)

Requests generated from an IoT device and passed back upwards towards the Context Broker (via an IoT agent) are known as
northbound traffic. Northbound traffic consists of **measurements** made by sensor devices and relays the state of the
real world into the context data of the system.

For example for a real-life **Motion Sensor** to send a count measurement the following interactions would occur:

1.  A **Motion Sensor** makes a measurement and passes the result to the **IoT Agent**
2.  The **IoT Agent** receives this Northbound request, converts the result from UltraLight syntax and passes the result
    of the interaction into the context by making an NGSI request to the **Context Broker**.
3.  The **Context Broker** receives this Northbound request and updates the context with the result of the measurement.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent/img/measurement-swimlane.png)

-   Requests between **IoT-Device** and **IoT-Agent** use native protocols
-   Requests between **IoT-Agent** and **Context-Broker** use NGSI

> **Note** Other more complex interactions are also possible, but this overview is sufficient to understand the basic
> principles of an IoT Agent.

## Common Functionality

As can be seen from the previous sections, although each IoT Agent will be unique since they interpret different
protocols, there will a large degree of similarity between IoT agents.

-   Offering a standard location to listen to device updates
-   Offering a standard location to listen to context data updates
-   Holding a list of devices and mapping context data attributes to device syntax
-   Security Authorization

This base functionality has been abstracted out into a common
[IoT Agent framework library](https://iotagent-node-lib.readthedocs.io/)

<h4>Device Monitor</h4>

For the purpose of this tutorial, a series of dummy IoT devices have been created, which will be attached to the context
broker. Details of the architecture and protocol used can be found in the [IoT Sensors tutorial](iot-sensors.md) The
state of each device can be seen on the UltraLight device monitor web page found at:
`http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

# Architecture

This application builds on the components created in [previous tutorials](subscriptions.md). It will make use of two
FIWARE components - the [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the
[IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Usage of the Orion Context Broker
(with proper context data flowing through it) is sufficient for an application to qualify as _“Powered by FIWARE”_. Both
the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on open source [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep
persistence of the information they hold. We will also be using the dummy IoT devices created in the
[previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md)

Therefore the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   The FIWARE [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
-   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive
    southbound requests using [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) and convert them to
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    commands for the devices
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations
    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys
-   The **Context Provider NGSI** proxy is not used in this tutorial. It does the following:
    -   receive requests using [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
    -   makes requests to publicly available data sources using their own APIs in a proprietary format
    -   returns context data back to the Orion Context Broker in
        [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) format.
-   The **Stock Management Frontend** is not used in this tutorial will it does the following:
    -   Display store information
    -   Show which products can be bought at each store
    -   Allow users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.
-   A webserver acting as set of [dummy IoT devices](iot-sensors.md) using the
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    protocol running over HTTP.

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the entities can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent/img/architecture.png)

The necessary configuration information for wiring up the IoT devices and the IoT Agent can be seen in the services
section of the associated `docker-compose.yml` file:

<h3>Dummy IoT Devices Configuration</h3>

```yaml
tutorial:
    image: fiware/tutorials.context-provider
    hostname: iot-sensors
    container_name: fiware-tutorial
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "3000"
        - "3001"
    ports:
        - "3000:3000"
        - "3001:3001"
    environment:
        - "DEBUG=tutorial:*"
        - "PORT=3000"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_HOST=iot-agent"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_PORT=7896"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_PORT=3001"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_API_KEY=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_TRANSPORT=HTTP"
```

The `tutorial` container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `3000` is exposed so we can see the web page displaying the Dummy IoT devices.
-   Port `3001` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can make UltraLight commands without
    being part of the same network.

The `tutorial` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                     | Value                        | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEBUG                   | `tutorial:*`                 | Debug flag used for logging                                                                                                               |
| WEB_APP_PORT            | `3000`                       | Port used by web-app which displays the dummy device data                                                                                 |
| IOTA_HTTP_HOST          | `iot-agent`                  | The hostname of the IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0 - see below                                                                              |
| IOTA_HTTP_PORT          | `7896`                       | The port that the IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0 will be listening on. `7896` is a common default for UltraLight over HTTP                  |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_PORT      | `3001`                       | Port used by the dummy IoT devices to receive commands                                                                                    |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_API_KEY   | `4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov` | Random security key used for UltraLight interactions - used to ensure the integrity of interactions between the devices and the IoT Agent |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_TRANSPORT | `HTTP`                       | The transport protocol used by the dummy IoT devices                                                                                      |

The other `tutorial` container configuration values described in the YAML file are not used in this tutorial.

<h3>IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0 Configuration</h3>

The [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be instantiated within a
Docker container. An official Docker image is available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/iotagent-ul/)
tagged `fiware/iotagent-ul`. The necessary configuration can be seen below:

```yaml
iot-agent:
    image: fiware/iotagent-ul:latest
    hostname: iot-agent
    container_name: fiware-iot-agent
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "4041"
        - "7896"
    ports:
        - "4041:4041"
        - "7896:7896"
    environment:
        - IOTA_CB_HOST=orion
        - IOTA_CB_PORT=1026
        - IOTA_NORTH_PORT=4041
        - IOTA_REGISTRY_TYPE=mongodb
        - IOTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
        - IOTA_TIMESTAMP=true
        - IOTA_CB_NGSI_VERSION=v2
        - IOTA_AUTOCAST=true
        - IOTA_MONGO_HOST=mongo-db
        - IOTA_MONGO_PORT=27017
        - IOTA_MONGO_DB=iotagentul
        - IOTA_HTTP_PORT=7896
        - IOTA_PROVIDER_URL=http://iot-agent:4041
```

The `iot-agent` container relies on the precence of the Orion Context Broker and uses a MongoDB database to hold device
information such as device URLs and Keys. The container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `7896` is exposed to receive Ultralight measurements over HTTP from the Dummy IoT devices
-   Port `4041` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can make provisioning commands without
    being part of the same network.

The `iot-agent` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                  | Value                   | Description                                                                                                                                           |

# Start Up

Before you start you should ensure that you have obtained or built the necessary Docker images locally. Please clone the
repository and create the necessary images by running the commands as shown:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Agent.git
cd tutorials.IoT-Agent

./services create
```

Thereafter, all services can be initialized from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Agent/blob/master/services) Bash script provided within the
repository:

```bash
./services start
```

> **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

---

# Provisioning an IoT Agent

To follow the tutorial correctly please ensure you have the device monitor page available in your browser and click on
the page to enable audio before you enter any cUrl commands. The device monitor displays the current state of an array
of dummy devices using Ultralight 2.0 syntax

<h4>Device Monitor</h4>
The device monitor can be found at: `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

## Checking the IoT Agent Service Health

You can check if the IoT Agent is running by making an HTTP request to the exposed port:

#### 1 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/about'
```

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "libVersion": "2.6.0-next",
    "port": "4041",
    "baseRoot": "/",
    "version": "1.6.0-next"
}
```

> **What if I get a `Failed to connect to localhost port 4041: Connection refused` Response?**
>
> If you get a `Connection refused` response, the IoT Agent cannot be found where expected for this tutorial - you will
> need to substitute the URL and port in each cUrl command with the corrected IP address. All the cUrl commands tutorial
> assume that the IoT Agent is available on `localhost:4041`.
>
> Try the following remedies:
>
> -   To check that the docker containers are running try the following:
>
> ```
> docker ps
> ```
>
> You should see four containers running. If the IoT Agent is not running, you can restart the containers as necessary.
> This command will also display open port information.
>
> -   If you have installed [`docker-machine`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) and
>     [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/), the context broker, IoT Agent and Dummy Device docker containers may
>     be running from another IP address - you will need to retrieve the virtual host IP as shown:
>
> ```
> curl -X GET \
>   'http://$(docker-machine ip default):4041/version'
> ```
>
> Alternatively run all your curl commands from within the container network:
>
> ```
> docker run --network fiware_default --rm appropriate/curl -s \
>  -X GET 'http://iot-agent:4041/iot/about'
> ```

## Connecting IoT Devices

The IoT Agent acts as a middleware between the IoT devices and the context broker. It therefore needs to be able to
create context data entities with unique IDs. Once a service has been provisioned and an unknown device makes a
measurement the IoT Agent add this to the context using the supplied `<device-id>` (unless the device is recognized and
can be mapped to a known ID.

There is no guarantee that every supplied IoT device `<device-id>` will always be unique, therefore all provisioning
requests to the IoT Agent require two mandatory headers:

-   `fiware-service` header is defined so that entities for a given service can be held in a separate mongoDB database.
-   `fiware-servicepath` can be used to differentiate between arrays of devices.

For example within a smart city application you would expect different `fiware-service` headers for different
departments (e.g. parks, transport, refuse collection etc.) and each `fiware-servicepath` would refer to specific park
and so on. This would mean that data and devices for each service can be identified and separated as needed, but the
data would not be siloed - for example data from a **Smart Bin** within a park can be combined with the **GPS Unit** of
a refuse truck to alter the route of the truck in an efficient manner.

The **Smart Bin** and **GPS Unit** are likely to come from different manufacturers and it cannot be guaranteed that
there is no overlap within `<device-id>`s used. The use of the `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers can
ensure that this is always the case, and allows the context broker to identify the original source of the context data.

### Provisioning a Service Group

Invoking group provision is always the first step in connecting devices since it is always necessary to supply an
authentication key with each measurement and the IoT Agent will not initially know which URL the context broker is
responding on.

It is also possible to set up default commands and attributes for all anonymous devices as well, but this is not done
within this tutorial as we will be provisioning each device separately.

This example provisions an anonymous group of devices. It tells the IoT Agent that a series of devices will be sending
messages to the `IOTA_HTTP_PORT` (where the IoT Agent is listening for **Northbound** communications)

#### 2 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "services": [
   {
     "apikey":      "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
     "cbroker":     "http://orion:1026",
     "entity_type": "Thing",
     "resource":    "/iot/d"
   }
 ]
}'
```

In the example the IoT Agent is informed that the `/iot/d` endpoint will be used and that devices will authenticate
themselves by including the token `4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov`. For an UltraLight IoT Agent this means devices will be
sending GET or POST requests to:

```text
http://iot-agent:7896/iot/d?i=<device_id>&k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov
```

Which should be familiar UltraLight 2.0 syntax from the [previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md).

When a measurement from an IoT device is received on the resource URL it needs to be interpreted and passed to the
context broker. The `entity_type` attribute provides a default `type` for each device which has made a request (in this
case anonymous devices will be known as `Thing` entities. Furthermore the location of the context broker (`cbroker`) is
needed, so that the IoT Agent can pass on any measurements received to the correct location. `cbroker` is an optional
attribute - if it is not provided, the IoT Agent uses the context broker URL as defined in the configuration file,
however it has been included here for completeness.

### Provisioning a Sensor

It is common good practice to use URNs following the NGSI-LD
[specification](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.01.01_60/gs_CIM009v010101p.pdf) when creating
entities. Furthermore it is easier to understand meaningful names when defining data attributes. These mappings can be
defined by provisioning a device individually.

Three types of measurement attributes can be provisioned:

-   `attributes` are active readings from the device
-   `lazy` attributes are only sent on request - The IoT Agent will inform the device to return the measurement
-   `static_attributes` are as the name suggests static data about the device (such as relationships) passed on to the
    context broker.

> **Note**: in the case where individual `id`s are not required, or aggregated data is sufficient the `attributes` can
> be defined within the provisioning service rather than individually.

#### 3 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "devices": [
   {
     "device_id":   "motion001",
     "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001",
     "entity_type": "Motion",
     "timezone":    "Europe/Berlin",
     "attributes": [
       { "object_id": "c", "name": "count", "type": "Integer" }
     ],
     "static_attributes": [
       { "name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship", "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
     ]
   }
 ]
}
'
```

In the request we are associating the device `motion001` with the URN `urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001` and mapping the device
reading `c` with the context attribute `count` (which is defined as an `Integer`) A `refStore` is defined as a
`static_attribute`, placing the device within **Store** `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`

You can simulate a dummy IoT device measurement coming from the **Motion Sensor** device `motion001`, by making the
following request

#### 4 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:7896/iot/d?k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov&i=motion001' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d 'c|1'
```

A similar request was made in the previous tutorial (before the IoT Agent was connected) when the door was unlocked, you
will have seen the state of each motion sensor changing and a Northbound request will be logged in the device monitor.

Now the IoT Agent is connected, the service group has defined the resource upon which the IoT Agent is listening
(`iot/d`) and the API key used to authenticate the request (`4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov`). Since both of these are
recognized, the measurement is valid.

Because we have specifically provisioned the device (`motion001`) - the IoT Agent is able to map attributes before
raising a request with the Orion Context Broker.

You can see that a measurement has been recorded, by retrieving the entity data from the context broker. Don't forget to
add the `fiware-service` and `fiware-service-path` headers.

#### 5 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001' \
  -d 'type=Motion' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001", "type": "Motion",
    "TimeInstant": {
        "type": "ISO8601","value": "2018-05-25T10:51:32.00Z",
        "metadata": {}
    },
    "count": {
        "type": "Integer","value": "1",
        "metadata": {
            "TimeInstant": {"type": "ISO8601","value": "2018-05-25T10:51:32.646Z"}
        }
    },
    "refStore": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001",
        "metadata": {
            "TimeInstant": {"type": "ISO8601", "value": "2018-05-25T10:51:32.646Z"
        }
    }
}
```

The response shows that the **Motion Sensor** device with `id=motion001` has been successfully identified by the IoT
Agent and mapped to the entity `id=urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001`. This new entity has been created within the context data.
The `c` attribute from the dummy device measurement request has been mapped to the more meaningful `count` attribute
within the context. As you will notice, a `TimeInstant` attribute has been added to both the entity and the metadata of
the attribute - this represents the last time the entity and attribute have been updated, and is automatically added to
each new entity because the `IOTA_TIMESTAMP` environment variable was set when the IoT Agent was started up. The
`refStore` attribute comes from the `static_attributes` set when the device was provisioned.

### Provisioning an Actuator

Provisioning an actuator is similar to provisioning a sensor. This time an `endpoint` attribute holds the location where
the IoT Agent needs to send the UltraLight command and the `commands` array includes a list of each command that can be
invoked. The example below provisions a bell with the `deviceId=bell001`. The endpoint is
`http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell001` and it can accept the `ring` command. The `transport=HTTP` attribute defines the
communications protocol to be used.

#### 6 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "bell001",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
      "entity_type": "Bell",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "HTTP",
      "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell001",
      "commands": [
        { "name": "ring", "type": "command" }
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

Before we wire-up the context broker, we can test that a command can be sent to a device by making a REST request
directly to the IoT Agent's North Port using the `/v1/updateContext` endpoint. It is this endpoint that will eventually
be invoked by the context broker once we have connected it up. To test the configuration you can run the command
directly as shown:

#### 7 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/v1/updateContext' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
    "contextElements": [
        {
            "type": "Bell",
            "isPattern": "false",
            "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
            "attributes": [
                { "name": "ring", "type": "command", "value": "" }
            ],
            "static_attributes": [
               {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
            ]
        }
    ],
    "updateAction": "UPDATE"
}'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "contextResponses": [
        {
            "contextElement": {
                "attributes": [
                    {
                        "name": "ring",
                        "type": "command",
                        "value": ""
                    }
                ],
                "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
                "isPattern": false,
                "type": "Bell"
            },
            "statusCode": {
                "code": 200,
                "reasonPhrase": "OK"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can also see the state of the bell change.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent/img/bell-ring.gif)

The result of the command to ring the bell can be read by querying the entity within the Orion Context Broker.

#### 8 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001' \
  -d 'type=Bell' \
  -d 'options=keyValues' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
    "type": "Bell",
    "TimeInstant": "2018-05-25T20:06:28.00Z",
    "refStore": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001",
    "ring_info": " ring OK",
    "ring_status": "OK",
    "ring": ""
}
```

The `TimeInstant` shows last the time any command associated with the entity has been invoked. The result of `ring`
command can be seen in the value of the `ring_info` attribute.

### Provisioning a Smart Door

Provisioning a device which offers both commands and measurements is merely a matter of making an HTTP POST request with
both `attributes` and `command` attributes in the body of the request.

#### 9 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \

       ],
       "attributes": [
        {"object_id": "s", "name": "state", "type":"Text"},
        {"object_id": "l", "name": "luminosity", "type":"Integer"}
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

The full list of provisioned devices can be obtained by making a GET request to the `/iot/devices` endpoint.

#### 11 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

## Enabling Context Broker Commands

Having connected up the IoT Agent to the IoT devices, we now need to inform the Orion Context Broker that the commands
are available. In other words we need to register the IoT Agent as a [Context Provider](context-providers.md) for the
command attributes.

Once the commands have been registered it will be possible to ring the **Bell**, open and close the **Smart Door** and
switch the **Smart Lamp** on and off by sending requests to the Orion Context Broker, rather than sending UltraLight 2.0
requests directly the IoT devices as we did in the [previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md)

### Registering a Bell Command

The **Bell** entity has been mapped to `id="urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001"` with an entity `type="Bell"`. To register the command
we need to inform Orion that the URL `http://orion:1026/v1` is able to provide the missing `ring` attribute. This will
then be forwarded on to the IoT Agent. As you see this is an NGSI v1 endpoint and therefore the `legacyForwarding`
attribute must also be set.

#### 12 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/registrations' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{

    ],
    "attrs": ["ring"]
  },
  "provider": {
    "http": {"url": "http://orion:1026/v1"},
    "legacyForwarding": true
  }
}'
```

### Ringing the Bell

To invoke the `ring` command, the `ring` attribute must be updated in the context.

#### 13 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001/attrs' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "ring": {
      "type" : "command",
      "value" : ""
  }
}'
```

If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can also see the state of the bell change.

### Registering Smart Door Commands

The **Smart Door** entity has been mapped to `id="urn:ngsi-ld:Door:001"` with an entity `type="Door"`. To register the
commands we need to inform Orion that the URL `http://orion:1026/v1` is able to provide the missing attributes. This
will then be forwarded on to the IoT Agent. As you see this is an NGSI v1 endpoint and therefore the `legacyForwarding`
attribute must also be set.

### Opening the Smart Door

To invoke the `open` command, the `open` attribute must be updated in the context.

### Registering Smart Lamp Commands

The **Smart Lamp** entity has been mapped to `id="urn:ngsi-ld:Lamp:001"` with an entity `type="Lamp"`. To register the
commands we need to inform Orion that the URL `http://orion:1026/v1` is able to provide the missing attributes. This
will then be forwarded on to the IoT Agent. As you see this is an NGSI v1 endpoint and therefore the `legacyForwarding`
attribute must also be set.

## Service Group CRUD Actions

The **CRUD** operations for provisioning a service group map on to the expected HTTP verbs under the `/iot/services`
endpoint

-   **Create** - HTTP POST
-   **Read** - HTTP GET
-   **Update** - HTTP PUT
-   **Delete** - HTTP DELETE

Use the `resource` and `apikey` parameters to uniquely identify a service group.

### Creating a Service Group

This example provisions an anonymous group of devices. It tells the IoT Agent that a series of devices will be sending
messages to the `IOTA_HTTP_PORT` (where the IoT Agent is listening for **Northbound** communications)

#### 18 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

  -d '{
 "services": [
   {
     "apikey":      "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
     "cbroker":     "http://orion:1026",
     "entity_type": "Thing",
     "resource":    "/iot/d"
   }
 ]
}'
```

### Read Service Group Details

This example obtains the full details of a provisioned service with a given `resource` path.

Service group details can be read by making a GET request to the `/iot/services` endpoint and providing a `resource`
parameter.

#### 19 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -d 'resource=/iot/d' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \

    "lazy": [],
    "commands": [],
    "entity_type": "Thing",
    "internal_attributes": [],
    "static_attributes": []
}
```

The response includes all the defaults associated with each service group such as the `entity_type` and any default
commands or attribute mappings.

### List all Service Groups

This example lists all provisioned services by making a GET request to the `/iot/services` endpoint.

#### 20 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'

    "internal_attributes": [],
    "static_attributes": []
}
```

The response includes all the defaults associated with each service group such as the `entity_type` and any default
commands or attribute mappings.

### Update a Service Group

This example updates an existing service group with a given `resource` path and `apikey`

Service group details can be updated by making a PUT request to the `/iot/services` endpoint and providing a `resource`
and `apikey` parameters.

#### 21 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PUT \

### Delete a Service Group

This example removes a provisioned service group by making a DELETE request to the `/iot/services/` endpoint.

It means that requests to `http://iot-agent:7896/iot/d?i=<device_id>&k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov` (where the IoT Agent
is listening for **Northbound** communications) should no longer be processed by the IoT Agent. The `apiKey` and
`resource` parameters must be supplied in order to identify the service group to be deleted.

#### 22 Request:

```bash
curl -iX DELETE \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services/?resource=/iot/d&apikey=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

## Device CRUD Actions

The **CRUD** operations for provisioning individual devices map on to the expected HTTP verbs under the `/iot/devices`
endpoint

-   **Create** - HTTP POST
-   **Read** - HTTP GET
-   **Update** - HTTP PUT
-   **Delete** - HTTP DELETE

Use the `<device-id>` to uniquely identify a device.

### Creating a Provisioned Device

This example provisions an individual device. It maps the `device_id=bell002` to the entity URN `urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:002`
and gives the entity a type `Bell`. The IoT Agent has been informed that the device offers a single `ring` `command` and
is listening on `http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell002` using HTTP. `attributes`, `lazy` attributes and
`static_attributes` can also be provisioned.

#### 23 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "bell002",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:002",
      "entity_type": "Bell",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "HTTP",
      "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell002",
      "commands": [
        {
          "name": "ring",

        }
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Read Provisioned Device Details

This example obtains the full details of a provisioned device with a given `<device-id>` path.

Provisioned Device details can be read by making a GET request to the `/iot/devices/<device-id>` endpoint.

#### 24 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices/bell002' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

The response includes all the commands and attributes mappings associated with the device.

```json
{
    "device_id": "bell002",
    "service": "openiot",
    "service_path": "/",
    "entity_name": "urn:ngsi",
    "entity_type": "Bell",
    "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell002",
    "transport": "HTTP",
    "attributes": [],
    "lazy": [],
    "commands": [
        {
            "object_id": "ring",
            "name": "ring",
            "type": "command"
        }
    ],
    "static_attributes": [
        {
            "name": "refStore",
            "type": "Relationship",
            "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002"
        }
    ],
    "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight"
}
```

### List all Provisioned Devices

This example lists all provisioned devices by making a GET request to the `/iot/devices` endpoint.

#### 25 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

The response includes all the commands and attributes mappings associated with all devices.

```json
{
    "count": 5,
    "devices": [
      {
          "device_id": "bell002",
          "service": "openiot",
          "service_path": "/",
          "entity_name": "urn:ngsi",
          "entity_type": "Bell",
          "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell002",
          "transport": "HTTP",
          "attributes": [],
          "lazy": [],
          "commands": [
              {
                  "object_id": "ring",
                  "name": "ring",
                  "type": "command"
              }
          ],
          "static_attributes": [
              {
                  "name": "refStore",
                  "type": "Relationship",
                  "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002"
              }
          ],
          "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight"
      },
      etc...
    ]
}
```

### Update a Provisioned Device

This example updates an existing provisioned device by making a PUT request to the `/iot/devices/<device-id>` endpoint.

#### 26 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PUT \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices/bell002' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "entity_type": "IoT-Device"
}'
```

### Delete a Provisioned Device

This example removes a provisioned device by making a DELETE request to the `/iot/devices/<device-id>` endpoint.

The device attributes will no longer be mapped and commands can no longer be sent to the device. If the device is making
active measurements, they will still be handled with default values if the associated service has not been deleted.

#### 27 Request:

```bash
curl -iX DELETE \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices/bell002' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```
