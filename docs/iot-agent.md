# What is an IoT Agent?

> "In every operation there is an above the line and a below the line. Above the
> line is what you do by the book. Below the line is how you do the job."
>
> — John le Carré (A Perfect Spy)

An IoT Agent is a component that lets a group of devices send their data to and
be managed from a Context Broker using their own native protocols. IoT Agents
should also be able to deal with security aspects of the FIWARE platform
(authentication and authorization of the channel) and provide other common
services to the device programmer.

The Orion Context Broker exclusively uses
[NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) requests for all
of its interactions. Each IoT Agent provides a **North Port**
[NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) interface which
is used for context broker interactions and all interactions beneath this port
occur using the **native protocol** of the attached devices.

In effect, this brings a standard interface to all IoT interactions at the
context information management level. Each group of IoT devices are able to use
their own proprietary protocols and disparate transport mechanisms under the
hood whilst the associated IoT Agent offers a facade pattern to handle this
complexity.

IoT Agents already exist or are in development for many IoT communication
protocols and data models. Examples include the following:

-   [IoTAgent-JSON](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - a
    bridge between HTTP/MQTT messaging (with a JSON payload) and NGSI
-   [IoTAgent-LWM2M](https://fiware-iotagent-lwm2m.readthedocs.io/en/latest) - a
    bridge between the
    [Lightweight M2M](https://www.omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/)
    protocol and NGSI
-   [IoTAgent-UL](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest) - a
    bridge between HTTP/MQTT messaging (with an UltraLight2.0 payload) and NGSI
-   [IoTagent-LoRaWAN](https://fiware-lorawan.readthedocs.io/en/latest) - a
    bridge between the [LoRaWAN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/)
    protocol and NGSI

## Southbound Traffic (Commands)

HTTP requests generated by the Orion Context Broker and passed downwards towards
an IoT device (via an IoT agent) are known as southbound traffic. Southbound
traffic consists of **commands** made to actuator devices which alter the state
of the real world by their actions.

For example to switch on a real-life UltraLight 2.0 **Smart Lamp** the following
interactions would occur:

1. An NGSI PATCH request is sent to the **Context broker** to update the current
   context of **Smart Lamp**

-   this is effectively an indirect request invoke the `on` command of the
    **Smart Lamp**

2. The **Context Broker** finds the entity within the context and notes that the
   context provision for this attribute has been delegated to the IoT Agent
3. The **Context broker** sends an NGSI request to the North Port of the **IoT
   Agent** to invoke the command
4. The **IoT Agent** receives this Southbound request and converts it to
   UltraLight 2.0 syntax and passes it on to the **Smart Lamp**
5. The **Smart Lamp** switches on the lamp and returns the result of the command
   to the **IoT Agent** in UltraLight 2.0 syntax
6. The **IoT Agent** receives this Northbound request, interprets it and passes
   the result of the interaction into the context by making an NGSI request to
   the **Context Broker**.
7. The **Context Broker** receives this Northbound request and updates the
   context with the result of the command.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent/img/command-swimlane.png)

-   Requests between **User** and **Context Broker** use NGSI
-   Requests between **Context Broker** and **IoT Agent** use NGSI
-   Requests between **IoT Agent** and **IoT Device** use native protocols
-   Requests between **IoT Device** and **IoT Agent** use native protocols
-   Requests between **IoT Agent** and **Context Broker** use NGSI

## Northbound Traffic (Measurements)

Requests generated from an IoT device and passed back upwards towards the
Context Broker (via an IoT agent) are known as northbound traffic. Northbound
traffic consists of **measurements** made by sensor devices and relays the state
of the real world into the context data of the system.

For example for a real-life **Motion Sensor** to send a count measurement the
following interactions would occur:

1. A **Motion Sensor** makes a measurement and passes the result to the **IoT
   Agent**
2. The **IoT Agent** receives this Northbound request, converts the result from
   UltraLight syntax and passes the result of the interaction into the context
   by making an NGSI request to the **Context Broker**.
3. The **Context Broker** receives this Northbound request and updates the
   context with the result of the measurement.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent/img/measurement-swimlane.png)

-   Requests between **IoT-Device** and **IoT-Agent** use native protocols
-   Requests between **IoT-Agent** and **Context-Broker** use NGSI

> **Note** Other more complex interactions are also possible, but this overview
> is sufficient to understand the basic principles of an IoT Agent.

## Common Functionality

As can be seen from the previous sections, although each IoT Agent will be
unique since they interpret different protocols, there will a large degree of
similarity between IoT agents.

-   Offering a standard location to listen to device updates
-   Offering a standard location to listen to context data updates
-   Holding a list of devices and mapping context data attributes to device
    syntax
-   Security Authorization

This base functionality has been abstracted out into a common
[IoT Agent framework library](https://iotagent-node-lib.readthedocs.io/)

<h4>Device Monitor</h4>

For the purpose of this tutorial, a series of dummy IoT devices have been
created, which will be attached to the context broker. Details of the
architecture and protocol used can be found in the
[IoT Sensors tutorial](iot-sensors.md) The state of each device can be seen on
the UltraLight device monitor web page found at:
`http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

# Architecture

This application builds on the components created in
[previous tutorials](subscriptions.md). It will make use of two FIWARE
components - the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the
[IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Usage of the Orion Context Broker (with proper context data flowing through it)
is sufficient for an application to qualify as _“Powered by FIWARE”_. Both the
Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on open source
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep persistence of the
information they hold. We will also be using the dummy IoT devices created in
the [previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md)

Therefore the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   The FIWARE
    [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which
    will receive requests using
    [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
-   The FIWARE
    [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    which will receive southbound requests using
    [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) and convert
    them to
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    commands for the devices
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information
        such as data entities, subscriptions and registrations
    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs
        and Keys
-   The **Context Provider NGSI** proxy is not used in this tutorial. It does
    the following:
    -   receive requests using
        [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
    -   makes requests to publicly available data sources using their own APIs
        in a proprietary format
    -   returns context data back to the Orion Context Broker in
        [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) format.
-   The **Stock Management Frontend** is not used in this tutorial will it does
    the following:
    -   Display store information
    -   Show which products can be bought at each store
    -   Allow users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.
-   A webserver acting as set of [dummy IoT devices](iot-sensors.md) using the
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    protocol running over HTTP.

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the
entities can be containerized and run from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent/img/architecture.png)

The necessary configuration information for wiring up the IoT devices and the
IoT Agent can be seen in the services section of the associated
`docker-compose.yml` file:

<h3>Dummy IoT Devices Configuration</h3>

```yaml
tutorial:
    image: fiware/tutorials.context-provider
    hostname: iot-sensors
    container_name: fiware-tutorial
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "3000"
        - "3001"
    ports:
        - "3000:3000"
        - "3001:3001"
    environment:
        - "DEBUG=tutorial:*"
        - "PORT=3000"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_HOST=iot-agent"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_PORT=7896"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_PORT=3001"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_API_KEY=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_TRANSPORT=HTTP"
```

The `tutorial` container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `3000` is exposed so we can see the web page displaying the Dummy IoT
    devices.
-   Port `3001` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman
    can make UltraLight commands without being part of the same network.

The `tutorial` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                     | Value                        | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEBUG                   | `tutorial:*`                 | Debug flag used for logging                                                                                                               |
| WEB_APP_PORT            | `3000`                       | Port used by web-app which displays the dummy device data                                                                                 |
| IOTA_HTTP_HOST          | `iot-agent`                  | The hostname of the IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0 - see below                                                                              |
| IOTA_HTTP_PORT          | `7896`                       | The port that the IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0 will be listening on. `7896` is a common default for UltraLight over HTTP                  |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_PORT      | `3001`                       | Port used by the dummy IoT devices to receive commands                                                                                    |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_API_KEY   | `4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov` | Random security key used for UltraLight interactions - used to ensure the integrity of interactions between the devices and the IoT Agent |
| DUMMY_DEVICES_TRANSPORT | `HTTP`                       | The transport protocol used by the dummy IoT devices                                                                                      |

The other `tutorial` container configuration values described in the YAML file
are not used in this tutorial.

<h3>IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0 Configuration</h3>

The
[IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
can be instantiated within a Docker container. An official Docker image is
available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/iotagent-ul/) tagged
`fiware/iotagent-ul`. The necessary configuration can be seen below:

```yaml
iot-agent:
    image: fiware/iotagent-ul:latest
    hostname: iot-agent
    container_name: fiware-iot-agent
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "4041"
        - "7896"
    ports:
        - "4041:4041"
        - "7896:7896"
    environment:
        - "IOTA_CB_HOST=orion"
        - "IOTA_CB_PORT=1026"
        - "IOTA_NORTH_PORT=4041"
        - "IOTA_REGISTRY_TYPE=mongodb"
        - "IOTA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG"
        - "IOTA_TIMESTAMP=true"
        - "IOTA_MONGO_HOST=mongo-db"
        - "IOTA_MONGO_PORT=27017"
        - "IOTA_MONGO_DB=iotagentul"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_PORT=7896"
        - "IOTA_PROVIDER_URL=http://iot-agent:4041"
```

The `iot-agent` container relies on the precence of the Orion Context Broker and
uses a MongoDB database to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys.
The container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `7896` is exposed to receive Ultralight measurements over HTTP from the
    Dummy IoT devices
-   Port `4041` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman
    can make provisioning commands without being part of the same network.

The `iot-agent` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                | Value                   | Description                                                                                                                                           |

# Provisioning an IoT Agent

To follow the tutorial correctly please ensure you have the device monitor page
available in your browser and click on the page to enable audio before you enter
any cUrl commands. The device monitor displays the current state of an array of
dummy devices using Ultralight 2.0 syntax

<h4>Device Monitor</h4>
The device monitor can be found at: `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

## Checking the IoT Agent Service Health

You can check if the IoT Agent is running by making an HTTP request to the
exposed port:

#### 1 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/about'
```

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "libVersion": "2.6.0-next",
    "port": "4041",
    "baseRoot": "/",
    "version": "1.6.0-next"
}
```

> **What if I get a
> `Failed to connect to localhost port 4041: Connection refused` Response?**
>
> If you get a `Connection refused` response, the IoT Agent cannot be found
> where expected for this tutorial - you will need to substitute the URL and
> port in each cUrl command with the corrected IP address. All the cUrl commands
> tutorial assume that the IoT Agent is available on `localhost:4041`.
>
> Try the following remedies:
>
> -   To check that the docker containers are running try the following:
>
> ```
> docker ps
> ```
>
> You should see four containers running. If the IoT Agent is not running, you
> can restart the containers as necessary. This command will also display open
> port information.
>
> -   If you have installed [`docker-machine`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/)
>     and [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/), the context broker, IoT
>     Agent and Dummy Device docker containers may be running from another IP
>     address - you will need to retrieve the virtual host IP as shown:
>
> ```
> curl -X GET \
>   'http://$(docker-machine ip default):4041/version'
> ```
>
> Alternatively run all your curl commands from within the container network:
>
> ```
> docker run --network fiware_default --rm appropriate/curl -s \
>  -X GET 'http://iot-agent:4041/iot/about'
> ```

## Connecting IoT Devices

The IoT Agent acts as a middleware between the IoT devices and the context
broker. It therefore needs to be able to create context data entities with
unique IDs. Once a service has been provisioned and an unknown device makes a
measurement the IoT Agent add this to the context using the supplied
`<device-id>` (unless the device is recognized and can be mapped to a known ID.

There is no guarantee that every supplied IoT device `<device-id>` will always
be unique, therefore all provisioning requests to the IoT Agent require two
mandatory headers:

-   `fiware-service` header is defined so that entities for a given service can
    be held in a separate mongoDB database.
-   `fiware-servicepath` can be used to differentiate between arrays of devices.

For example within a smart city application you would expect different
`fiware-service` headers for different departments (e.g. parks, transport,
refuse collection etc.) and each `fiware-servicepath` would refer to specific
park and so on. This would mean that data and devices for each service can be
identified and separated as needed, but the data would not be siloed - for
example data from a **Smart Bin** within a park can be combined with the **GPS
Unit** of a refuse truck to alter the route of the truck in an efficient manner.

The **Smart Bin** and **GPS Unit** are likely to come from different
manufacturers and it cannot be guaranteed that there is no overlap within
`<device-id>`s used. The use of the `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath`
headers can ensure that this is always the case, and allows the context broker
to identify the original source of the context data.

### Provisioning a Service Group

Invoking group provision is always the first step in connecting devices since it
is always necessary to supply an authentication key with each measurement and
the IoT Agent will not initially know which URL the context broker is responding
on.

It is also possible to set up default commands and attributes for all anonymous
devices as well, but this is not done within this tutorial as we will be
provisioning each device separately.

This example provisions an anonymous group of devices. It tells the IoT Agent
that a series of devices will be sending messages to the `IOTA_HTTP_PORT` (where
the IoT Agent is listening for **Northbound** communications)

#### 2 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "services": [
   {
     "apikey":      "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
     "cbroker":     "http://orion:1026",
     "entity_type": "Thing",
     "resource":    "/iot/d"
   }
 ]
}'
```

In the example the IoT Agent is informed that the `/iot/d` endpoint will be used
and that devices will authenticate themselves by including the token
`4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov`. For an UltraLight IoT Agent this means devices
will be sending GET or POST requests to:

```
http://iot-agent:7896/iot/d?i=<device_id>&k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov
```

Which should be familiar UltraLight 2.0 syntax from the
[previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md).

When a measurement from an IoT device is received on the resource URL it needs
to be interpreted and passed to the context broker. The `entity_type` attribute
provides a default `type` for each device which has made a request (in this case
anonymous devices will be known as `Thing` entities. Furthermore the location of
the context broker (`cbroker`) is needed, so that the IoT Agent can pass on any
measurements received to the correct location. `cbroker` is an optional
attribute - if it is not provided, the IoT Agent uses the context broker URL as
defined in the configuration file, however it has been included here for
completeness.

### Provisioning a Sensor

It is common good practice to use URNs following the NGSI-LD
[draft recommendation](https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/CIM/Open/ISG_CIM_NGSI-LD_API_Draft_for_public_review.pdf)
when creating entities. Furthermore it is easier to understand meaningful names
when defining data attributes. These mappings can be defined by provisioning a
device individually.

Three types of measurement attributes can be provisioned:

-   `attributes` are active readings from the device
-   `lazy` attributes are only sent on request - The IoT Agent will inform the
    device to return the measurement
-   `static_attributes` are as the name suggests static data about the device
    (such as relationships) passed on to the context broker.

> **Note**: in the case where individual `id`s are not required, or aggregated
> data is sufficient the `attributes` can be defined within the provisioning
> service rather than individually.

#### 3 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "devices": [
   {
     "device_id":   "motion001",
     "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001",
     "entity_type": "Motion",
     "timezone":    "Europe/Berlin",
     "attributes": [
       { "object_id": "c", "name": "count", "type": "Integer" }
     ],
     "static_attributes": [
       { "name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship", "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
     ]
   }
 ]
}
'
```

In the request we are associating the device `motion001` with the URN
`urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001` and mapping the device reading `c` with the context
attribute `count` (which is defined as an `Integer`) A `refStore` is defined as
a `static_attribute`, placing the device within **Store**
`urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`

You can simulate a dummy IoT device measurement coming from the **Motion
Sensor** device `motion001`, by making the following request

#### 4 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:7896/iot/d?k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov&i=motion001' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d 'c|1'
```

A similar request was made in the previous tutorial (before the IoT Agent was
connected) when the door was unlocked, you will have seen the state of each
motion sensor changing and a Northbound request will be logged in the device
monitor.

Now the IoT Agent is connected, the service group has defined the resource upon
which the IoT Agent is listening (`iot/d`) and the API key used to authenticate
the request (`4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov`). Since both of these are recognized,
the measurement is valid.

Because we have specifically provisioned the device (`motion001`) - the IoT
Agent is able to map attributes before raising a request with the Orion Context
Broker.

You can see that a measurement has been recorded, by retrieving the entity data
from the context broker. Don't forget to add the `fiware-service` and
`fiware-service-path` headers.

#### 5 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001' \
  -d 'type=Motion' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001", "type": "Motion",
    "TimeInstant": {
        "type": "ISO8601","value": "2018-05-25T10:51:32.00Z",
        "metadata": {}
    },
    "count": {
        "type": "Integer","value": "1",
        "metadata": {
            "TimeInstant": {"type": "ISO8601","value": "2018-05-25T10:51:32.646Z"}
        }
    },
    "refStore": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001",
        "metadata": {
            "TimeInstant": {"type": "ISO8601", "value": "2018-05-25T10:51:32.646Z"
        }
    }
}
```

The response shows that the **Motion Sensor** device with `id=motion001` has
been successfully identified by the IoT Agent and mapped to the entity
`id=urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001`. This new entity has been created within the context
data. The `c` attribute from the dummy device measurement request has been
mapped to the more meaningful `count` attribute within the context. As you will
notice, a `TimeInstant` attribute has been added to both the entity and the meta
data of the attribute - this represents the last time the entity and attribute
have been updated, and is automatically added to each new entity because the
`IOTA_TIMESTAMP` environment variable was set when the IoT Agent was started up.
The `refStore` attribute comes from the `static_attributes` set when the device
was provisioned.

### Provisioning an Actuator

Provisioning an actuator is similar to provisioning a sensor. This time an
`endpoint` attribute holds the location where the IoT Agent needs to send the
UltraLight command and the `commands` array includes a list of each command that
can be invoked. The example below provisions a bell with the `deviceId=bell001`.
The endpoint is `http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell001` and it can accept the
`ring` command. The `transport=HTTP` attribute defines the communications
protocol to be used.

#### 6 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "bell001",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
      "entity_type": "Bell",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "HTTP",
      "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell001",
      "commands": [
        { "name": "ring", "type": "command" }
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

Before we wire-up the context broker, we can test that a command can be sent to
a device by making a REST request directly to the IoT Agent's North Port using
the `/v1/updateContext` endpoint. It is this endpoint that will eventually be
invoked by the context broker once we have connected it up. To test the
configuration you can run the command directly as shown:

#### 7 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/v1/updateContext' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
    "contextElements": [
        {
            "type": "Bell",
            "isPattern": "false",
            "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
            "attributes": [
                { "name": "ring", "type": "command", "value": "" }
            ],
            "static_attributes": [
               {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
            ]
        }
    ],
    "updateAction": "UPDATE"
}'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "contextResponses": [
        {
            "contextElement": {
                "attributes": [
                    {
                        "name": "ring",
                        "type": "command",
                        "value": ""
                    }
                ],
                "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
                "isPattern": false,
                "type": "Bell"
            },
            "statusCode": {
                "code": 200,
                "reasonPhrase": "OK"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can also see the state of the
bell change.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.IoT-Agent/img/bell-ring.gif)

The result of the command to ring the bell can be read by querying the entity
within the Orion Context Broker.

#### 8 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001' \
  -d 'type=Bell' \
  -d 'options=keyValues' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001",
    "type": "Bell",
    "TimeInstant": "2018-05-25T20:06:28.00Z",
    "refStore": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001",
    "ring_info": " ring OK",
    "ring_status": "OK",
    "ring": ""
}
```

The `TimeInstant` shows last the time any command associated with the entity has
been invoked. The result of `ring` command can be seen in the value of the
`ring_info` attribute.

### Provisioning a Smart Door

Provisioning a device which offers both commands and measurements is merely a
matter of making an HTTP POST request with both `attributes` and `command`
attributes in the body of the request.

#### 9 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

       ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

### Provisioning a Smart Lamp

Similarly, a **Smart Lamp** with two commands (`on` and `off`) and two
attributes can be provisioned as follows:

#### 10 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "lamp001",

      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "HTTP",
      "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/lamp001",
      "commands": [
        {"name": "on","type": "command"},
        {"name": "off","type": "command"}
       ],
       "attributes": [
        {"object_id": "s", "name": "state", "type":"Text"},
        {"object_id": "l", "name": "luminosity", "type":"Integer"}
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
'
```

The full list of provisioned devices can be obtained by making a GET request to
the `/iot/devices` endpoint.

#### 11 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

## Enabling Context Broker Commands

Having connected up the IoT Agent to the IoT devices, we now need to inform the
Orion Context Broker that the commands are available. In other words we need to
register the IoT Agent as a [Context Provider](context-providers.md) for the
command attributes.

Once the commands have been registered it will be possible to ring the **Bell**,
open and close the **Smart Door** and switch the **Smart Lamp** on and off by
sending requests to the Orion Context Broker, rather than sending UltraLight 2.0
requests directly the IoT devices as we did in the
[previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md)

### Registering a Bell Command

The **Bell** entity has been mapped to `id="urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001"` with an
entity `type="Bell"`. To register the command we need to inform Orion that the
URL `http://orion:1026/v1` is able to provide the missing `ring` attribute. This
will then be forwarded on to the IoT Agent. As you see this is an NGSI v1
endpoint and therefore the `legacyForwarding` attribute must also be set.

#### 12 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/registrations' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{

      }
    ],
    "attrs": ["ring"]
  },
  "provider": {
    "http": {"url": "http://orion:1026/v1"},
    "legacyForwarding": true
  }
}'
```

### Ringing the Bell

To invoke the `ring` command, the `ring` attribute must be updated in the
context.

#### 13 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001/attrs' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "ring": {
      "type" : "command",
      "value" : ""
  }
}'
```

If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can also see the state of the
bell change.

### Registering Smart Door Commands

The **Smart Door** entity has been mapped to `id="urn:ngsi-ld:Door:001"` with an
entity `type="Door"`. To register the commands we need to inform Orion that the
URL `http://orion:1026/v1` is able to provide the missing attributes. This will
then be forwarded on to the IoT Agent. As you see this is an NGSI v1 endpoint
and therefore the `legacyForwarding` attribute must also be set.

#### 14 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/registrations' \

```

### Opening the Smart Door

To invoke the `open` command, the `open` attribute must be updated in the
context.

#### 15 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Lamp:001/attrs' \

### Registering Smart Lamp Commands

The **Smart Lamp** entity has been mapped to `id="urn:ngsi-ld:Lamp:001"` with an
entity `type="Lamp"`. To register the commands we need to inform Orion that the
URL `http://orion:1026/v1` is able to provide the missing attributes. This will
then be forwarded on to the IoT Agent. As you see this is an NGSI v1 endpoint
and therefore the `legacyForwarding` attribute must also be set.

### Switching on the Smart Lamp

To switch on the **Smart Lamp**, the `on` attribute must be updated in the
context.

#### 17 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PATCH \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Lamp:001/attrs' \

## Service Group CRUD Actions

The **CRUD** operations for provisioning a service group map on to the expected
HTTP verbs under the `/iot/services` endpoint

-   **Create** - HTTP POST
-   **Read** - HTTP GET
-   **Update** - HTTP PUT
-   **Delete** - HTTP DELETE

Use the `resource` and `apikey` parameters to uniquely identify a service group.

### Creating a Service Group

This example provisions an anonymous group of devices. It tells the IoT Agent
that a series of devices will be sending messages to the `IOTA_HTTP_PORT` (where
the IoT Agent is listening for **Northbound** communications)

#### 18 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "services": [
   {
     "apikey":      "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
     "cbroker":     "http://orion:1026",
     "entity_type": "Thing",
     "resource":    "/iot/d"
   }
 ]
}'
```

### Read Service Group Details

This example obtains the full details of a provisioned service with a given
`resource` path.

Service group details can be read by making a GET request to the `/iot/services`
endpoint and providing a `resource` parameter.

#### 19 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -d 'resource=/iot/d' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "_id": "5b07b2c3d7eec57836ecfed4",
    "subservice": "/",
    "service": "openiot",
    "apikey": "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
    "resource": "/iot/d",
    "attributes": [],
    "lazy": [],
    "commands": [],
    "entity_type": "Thing",
    "internal_attributes": [],
    "static_attributes": []
}
```

The response includes all the defaults associated with each service group such
as the `entity_type` and any default commands or attribute mappings.

### List all Service Groups

This example lists all provisioned services by making a GET request to the
`/iot/services` endpoint.

#### 20 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "_id": "5b07b2c3d7eec57836ecfed4",
    "subservice": "/",
    "service": "openiot",
    "apikey": "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
    "resource": "/iot/d",
    "attributes": [],
    "lazy": [],
    "commands": [],
    "entity_type": "Thing",
    "internal_attributes": [],
    "static_attributes": []
}
```

The response includes all the defaults associated with each service group such
as the `entity_type` and any default commands or attribute mappings.

### Update a Service Group

This example updates an existing service group with a given `resource` path and
`apikey`

Service group details can be updated by making a PUT request to the
`/iot/services` endpoint and providing a `resource` and `apikey` parameters.

#### 21 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PUT \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services?resource=/iot/d&apikey=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "entity_type": "IoT-Device"
}'
```

### Delete a Service Group

This example removes a provisioned service group by making a DELETE request to
the `/iot/services/` endpoint.

It means that requests to
`http://iot-agent:7896/iot/d?i=<device_id>&k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov` (where
the IoT Agent is listening for **Northbound** communications) should no longer
be processed by the IoT Agent. The `apiKey` and `resource` parameters must be
supplied in order to identify the service group to be deleted.

#### 22 Request:

```bash
curl -iX DELETE \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services/?resource=/iot/d&apikey=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov' \

## Device CRUD Actions

The **CRUD** operations for provisioning individual devices map on to the
expected HTTP verbs under the `/iot/devices` endpoint

-   **Create** - HTTP POST
-   **Read** - HTTP GET
-   **Update** - HTTP PUT
-   **Delete** - HTTP DELETE

Use the `<device-id>` to uniquely identify a device.

### Creating a Provisioned Device

This example provisions an individual device. It maps the `device_id=bell002` to
the entity URN `urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:002` and gives the entity a type `Bell`. The
IoT Agent has been informed that the device offers a single `ring` `command` and
is listening on `http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell002` using HTTP. `attributes`,
`lazy` attributes and `static_attributes` can also be provisioned.

#### 23 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "bell002",
      "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:002",
      "entity_type": "Bell",
      "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight",
      "transport": "HTTP",
      "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell002",
      "commands": [
        {
          "name": "ring",
          "type": "command"
        }
       ],
       "static_attributes": [
         {"name":"refStore", "type": "Relationship","value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Read Provisioned Device Details

This example obtains the full details of a provisioned device with a given
`<device-id>` path.

Provisioned Device details can be read by making a GET request to the
`/iot/devices/<device-id>` endpoint.

#### 24 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices/bell002' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

The response includes all the commands and attributes mappings associated with
the device.

```json
{
    "device_id": "bell002",
    "service": "openiot",
    "service_path": "/",
    "entity_name": "urn:ngsi",
    "entity_type": "Bell",
    "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell002",
    "transport": "HTTP",
    "attributes": [],
    "lazy": [],
    "commands": [
        {
            "object_id": "ring",
            "name": "ring",
            "type": "command"
        }
    ],
    "static_attributes": [
        {
            "name": "refStore",
            "type": "Relationship",
            "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002"
        }
    ],
    "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight"
}
```

### List all Provisioned Devices

This example lists all provisioned devices by making a GET request to the
`/iot/devices` endpoint.

#### 25 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

The response includes all the commands and attributes mappings associated with
all devices.

```json
{
    "count": 5,
    "devices": [
      {
          "device_id": "bell002",
          "service": "openiot",
          "service_path": "/",
          "entity_name": "urn:ngsi",
          "entity_type": "Bell",
          "endpoint": "http://iot-sensors:3001/iot/bell002",
          "transport": "HTTP",
          "attributes": [],
          "lazy": [],
          "commands": [
              {
                  "object_id": "ring",
                  "name": "ring",
                  "type": "command"
              }
          ],
          "static_attributes": [
              {
                  "name": "refStore",
                  "type": "Relationship",
                  "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002"
              }
          ],
          "protocol": "PDI-IoTA-UltraLight"
      },
      etc...
    ]
}
```

### Update a Provisioned Device

This example updates an existing provisioned device by making a PUT request to
the `/iot/devices/<device-id>` endpoint.

#### 26 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PUT \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices/bell002' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "entity_type": "IoT-Device"
}'
```

### Delete a Provisioned Device

This example removes a provisioned device by making a DELETE request to the
`/iot/devices/<device-id>` endpoint.

The device attributes will no longer be mapped and commands can no longer be
sent to the device. If the device is making active measurements, they will still
be handled with default values if the associated service has not been deleted.

#### 27 Request:

```bash
curl -iX DELETE \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices/bell002' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```
