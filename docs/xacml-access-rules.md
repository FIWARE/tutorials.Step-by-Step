[![FIWARE Security](https://nexus.lab.fiware.org/repository/raw/public/badges/chapters/security.svg)](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/)

**Description:** This tutorial introduces an additional security generic enabler - **Authzforce**
and adds fine grained control to the security rules generated by **Keyrock**.
Access to the entities created in the
[previous tutorial](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.PEP-Proxy) is now
configured and controlled using an XACML access control policy - this creates a
flexible ruleset which can be uploaded and reinterpreted on the fly so complex
business rules can be created and changed according to current circumstances.

The tutorial discusses code showing how to integrate **Authzforce** within a web
application and demonstrates examples of **Authzforce** XACML Server-PDP
interactions. [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands are used to show the
interactions between generic enablers.
[Postman documentation](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.XACML-Access-Rules/)
is available.

# Ruleset Based Permissions

> "Say: Come, I will rehearse what _Allah_ hath prohibited you from:
>
> -   Join not anything as equal with _Him_
> -   Be good to your parents
> -   Kill not your children on a plea of want - _We_ provide sustenance for you
>     and for them
> -   Come not nigh to shameful deeds. Whether open or secret
> -   Take not life, which _Allah_ hath made sacred, except by way of justice
>     and law
>
> thus doth _He_ command you, that ye may learn wisdom."
>
> — Quran 6.151, Sūrat al-Anʻām

[Previous tutorials](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Securing-Access) have
introduced a simple access control system based on authentication (level 1) or
basic authorization access to resources based on a role (level 2). These
policies are easy to create, but the rules within them are very black and white,
rules cannot rely on one another, have exception clauses or offer access based
on time limits or attribute values. There is also no mechanism to resolve
different rules in the case of conflict.

To satisfy a complex access control scenario, an additional arbitration
microservice is required, which is able to come to a judgement on each
Permit/Deny policy decision by reading and interpreting the full set of access
control rules, and based their judgement on the evidence provided by the
requesting service.

FIWARE [Authzforce](https://authzforce-ce-fiware.readthedocs.io/) is a service
which is able to provide such an interpretive Policy Decision Point (PDP). It is
an advanced access control Generic Enabler which is able to interpret rules
supplied using the
[XACML standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xacml).
Rulesets can be amended and uploaded at any time providing a flexible method to
maintain security policies which can change according to business need.
Furthermore the language used to describe the access policy is designed to be
highly extensible and cover any access control scenario.

## What is XACML

eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is a vendor neutral
declarative access control policy language. It was created to promote common
access control terminology and interoperability. The architectural naming
conventions for elements such as Policy Execution Point (PEP) and Policy
Decision Point (PDP) come from the XACML specifications.

XACML policies are split into a hierarchy of three levels - `<PolicySet>`,
`<Policy>` and `<Rule>`, the `<PolicySet>` is a collection of `<Policy>`
elements each of which contain one or more `<Rule>` elements.

Each `<Rule>` within a `<Policy>` is evaluated as to whether it should grant
access to a resource - the overall `<Policy>` result is defined by the overall
result of all `<Rule>` elements processed in turn. Separate `<Policy>` results
are then evaluated against each other using combining alogorthms define which
`<Policy>` wins in case of conflict.

A `<Rule>` element consists of a `<Target>` and a `<Condition>`. This is an
example `<Rule>`, it states access will be granted (`Effect="Permit"`) when a
POST request is sent to the `/bell/ring` endpoint, provided that the
`subject:role` has been provided and that the
`role=security-role-0000-0000-000000000000` :

```xml
<Rule RuleId="alrmbell-ring-0000-0000-000000000000" Effect="Permit">
  <Description>Ring Alarm Bell</Description>
  <Target>
    <AnyOf>
      <AllOf>
        <Match MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
          <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">/bell/ring</AttributeValue>
          <AttributeDesignator Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource" AttributeId="urn:thales:xacml:2.0:resource:sub-resource-id" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" MustBePresent="true" />
        </Match>
      </AllOf>
    </AnyOf>
    <AnyOf>
      <AllOf>
        <Match MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
          <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">POST</AttributeValue>
          <AttributeDesignator Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action" AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" MustBePresent="true" />
        </Match>
      </AllOf>
    </AnyOf>
  </Target>
  <Condition>
    <Apply FunctionId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:any-of">
      <Function FunctionId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal" />
      <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">security-role-0000-0000-000000000000</AttributeValue>
      <AttributeDesignator Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject-category:access-subject" AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:subject:role" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" MustBePresent="false" />
    </Apply>
  </Condition>
</Rule>
```

This is a very verbose method for creating a simple Verb-Resource access rule,
but unlike simple Verb-Resource rules, with XACML, other more complex
comparisons can be made, for example checking that time is before a certain hour
of day, or checking that a URL starts with or contains a certain string.
Conditions can be specified down to the attribute level or combined to make
complex calculations, for example - an XACML `<Rule>` could be created to apply
the following policy:

> _A store manager is able to amend Product prices only the first of the month,
> and can only alter prices of products she or her immediate superior has
> created in the first place_

Such a `<Rule>` would require that the `<Condition>` includes separate
clauses/clarifications for the following:

-   What is the User's role? (e.g. `manager`)
-   What action is being invoked? (e.g PATCH or PUT)
-   Which resource is being protected URL string? (e.g. `/v2/entities`)
-   What other information must be present in the body of the request? (e.g.
    Entity `type` must equal `Product`)
-   When is the resource being requested? (e.g. the current date)
-   What other additional information must be retrieved from elsewhere prior to
    making the request
    -   Who created the entity? Is it me or my manager?

As you can see these rules can quickly become very complex. For this initial
introduction to XACML, the basic rule set used will be kept as simple as
possible to avoid unnecessary confusion, suffice it to say that an access policy
based on XACML can be expanded to fit the security needs of any complex system.

# Architecture

This application adds level 3 Advanced Authorization security into the existing
Stock Management and Sensors-based application created in
[previous tutorials](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Securing-Access/) and
secures access to the context broker behind a
[PEP Proxy](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.PEP-Proxy/). It will make use of
five FIWARE components - the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),the
[IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
the [Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Identity Manager,
the [Wilma]() PEP Proxy and the
[Authzforce](https://authzforce-ce-fiware.readthedocs.io) XACML Server. All
access control decisions will be delegated to **Authzforce** which will read the
ruleset from a previously uploaded policy domain.

Both the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on open source
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep persistence of the
information they hold. We will also be using the dummy IoT devices created in
the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.IoT-Sensors/).
**Keyrock** uses its own [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database.

Therefore the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   The FIWARE
    [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which
    will receive requests using
    [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
-   The FIWARE
    [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    which will receive southbound requests using
    [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) and convert
    them to
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    commands for the devices
-   FIWARE [Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offer a
    complement Identity Management System including:
    -   An OAuth2 authentication system for Applications and Users
    -   A site graphical frontend for Identity Management Administration
    -   An equivalent REST API for Identity Management via HTTP requests
-   FIWARE [Authzforce](https://authzforce-ce-fiware.readthedocs.io/) is a XACML
    Server providing an interpretive Policy Decision Point (PDP) access to the
    **Orion** and/or **IoT Agent** microservices
-   FIWARE [Wilma](https://fiware-pep-proxy.rtfd.io/) is a PEP Proxy securing
    access to the **Orion** microservices, it delegates the passing of
    authorisation decisions to **Authzforce** PDP
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information
        such as data entities, subscriptions and registrations
    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs
        and Keys
-   A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database :
    -   Used to persist user identities, applications, roles and permissions
-   The **Stock Management Frontend** does the following:
    -   Displays store information
    -   Shows which products can be bought at each store
    -   Allows users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.
    -   Allows authorized users into restricted areas, it also delegates
        authoriation decisions to the **Authzforce** PDP
-   A webserver acting as set of
    [dummy IoT devices](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.IoT-Sensors) using
    the
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    protocol running over HTTP - access to certain resources is restricted.

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the
entities can be containerized and run from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.XACML-Access-Rules/img/architecture.png)

The specific architecture of each section of the tutorial is discussed below.

<h3>Keyrock Configuration</h3>

```yaml
keyrock:
    image: fiware/idm
    container_name: fiware-keyrock
    hostname: keyrock
    networks:
        default:
            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.5
    depends_on:
        - mysql-db
        - authzforce
    ports:
        - "3005:3005"
    environment:
        - DEBUG=idm:*
        - DATABASE_HOST=mysql-db
        - IDM_DB_PASS_FILE=/run/secrets/my_secret_data
        - IDM_DB_USER=root
        - IDM_HOST=http://localhost:3005
        - IDM_PORT=3005
        - IDM_ADMIN_USER=alice
        - IDM_ADMIN_EMAIL=alice-the-admin@test.com
        - IDM_ADMIN_PASS=test
        - IDM_PDP_LEVEL=advanced
        - IDM_AUTHZFORCE_ENABLED=true
        - IDM_AUTHZFORCE_HOST=authzforce
        - IDM_AUTHZFORCE_PORT=8080
    secrets:
        - my_secret_data
```

The `keyrock` container is a web application server listening on a single port:

-   Port `3005` has been exposed for HTTP traffic so we can display the web page
    and interact with the REST API.

The `keyrock` container is connecting to **Authzforce** and is driven by
environment variables as shown:

| Key                    | Value        | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IDM_PDP_LEVEL          | `advanced`   | Flag indicating that **Keyrock** should delegate PDP decisions to Authzforce |
| PEP_PROXY_AZF_PROTOCOL | `http`       | Transport protocol used by the XACML Server microservice                     |
| PEP_PROXY_AZF_HOST     | `authzforce` | This is URL where the **Authzforce** is found users                          |
| PEP_PROXY_AZF_PORT     | `8080`       | Port that **Authzforce** is listening on                                     |

The other `keyrock` container configuration values described in the YAML file
have been described in previous tutorials

<h3>PEP Proxy Configuration</h3>

```yaml
orion-proxy:
    image: fiware/pep-proxy
    container_name: fiware-orion-proxy
    hostname: orion-proxy
    networks:
        default:
            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.10
    depends_on:
        - keyrock
        - authzforce
    ports:
        - "1027:1027"
    expose:
        - "1027"
    environment:
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_HOST=orion
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_PORT=1026
        - PEP_PROXY_PORT=1027
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_HOST=keyrock
        - PEP_PROXY_HTTPS_ENABLED=false
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_SSL_ENABLED=false
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_PORT=3005
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_ID=tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp
        - PEP_PROXY_USERNAME=pep_proxy_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        - PEP_PASSWORD=test
        - PEP_PROXY_PDP=authzforce
        - PEP_PROXY_AUTH_ENABLED=true
        - PEP_PROXY_MAGIC_KEY=1234
        - PEP_PROXY_AZF_PROTOCOL=http
        - PEP_PROXY_AZF_HOST=authzforce
        - PEP_PROXY_AZF_PORT=8080
```

The `orion-proxy` container is an instance of FIWARE **Wilma** listening on port
`1027`, it is configured to forward traffic to `orion` on port `1026`, which is
the default port that the Orion Context Broker is listening to for NGSI
Requests.

The `orion-proxy` container is delegating PDP decisions to **Authzforce** and is
driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                    | Value        | Description                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| PEP_PROXY_PDP          | `authzforce` | Flag ensuring that the PEP Proxy uses Authzforce as a PDP |
| PEP_PROXY_AZF_PROTOCOL | `http`       | Flag to enable use of the XACML PDP                       |
| PEP_PROXY_AZF_HOST     | `authzforce` | This is URL where the **Authzforce** is found users       |
| PEP_PROXY_AZF_PORT     | `8080`       | Port that **Authzforce** is listening on                  |

The other `orion-proxy` container configuration values described in the YAML
file have been described in previous tutorials

<h3>Authzforce Configuration</h3>

```yaml
authzforce:
    image: fiware/authzforce-ce-server
    hostname: authzforce
    container_name: fiware-authzforce
    networks:
        default:
            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.12
    ports:
        - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
        - ./authzforce/domains:/opt/authzforce-ce-server/data/domains
```

The `authzforce` container is listening on port `8080`, where it receives
requests to make PDP decisions. A volume has been exposed to upload a
pre-configured domain so that a set of XACML access control policies has already
been supplied.

<h3>Tutorial Security Configuration</h3>

```yaml
tutorial:
    image: fiware/tutorials.context-provider
    hostname: tutorial
    container_name: fiware-tutorial
    networks:
        default:
            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.7
    expose:
        - "3000"
        - "3001"
    ports:
        - "3000:3000"
        - "3001:3001"
    environment:
        - "DEBUG=tutorial:*"
        - "WEB_APP_PORT=3000"
        - "KEYROCK_URL=http://localhost"
        - "KEYROCK_IP_ADDRESS=http://172.18.1.5"
        - "KEYROCK_PORT=3005"
        - "KEYROCK_CLIENT_ID=tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp"
        - "KEYROCK_CLIENT_SECRET=tutorial-dckr-site-0000-clientsecret"
        - "CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/login"
        - "AUTHZFORCE_ENABLED=true"
        - "AUTHZFORCE_URL=http://authzforce"
        - "AUTHZFORCE_PORT=8080"
```

The `tutorial` container is listening on two ports:

-   Port `3000` is exposed so we can see the web page displaying the Dummy IoT
    devices.
-   Port `3001` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman
    can make UltraLight commands without being part of the same network.

The `tutorial` container is now secured by **Authforce**, and is driven by
environment variables as shown:

| Key                | Value               | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| AUTHZFORCE_ENABLED | `true`              | Flag to enable use of the XACML PDP                 |
| AUTHZFORCE_URL     | `http://authzforce` | This is URL where the **Authzforce** is found users |
| AUTHZFORCE_PORT    | `8080`              | Port that **Authzforce** is listening on            |

The other `tutorial` container configuration values described in the YAML file
have been described in previous tutorials

### Authzforce - Obtain Version Information

Once **Authzforce** is running, you can check the status by making an HTTP
request to the exposed administration port (usually `8080`. If the response is
blank, this is usually because **Authzforce** is not running or is listening on
another port.

#### 1 Request

```bash
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/authzforce-ce/version \
  -H 'Accept: application/xml'
```

#### Response

The response returns information about the version of Authzforce.

```xml

# Using an XACML Server

**Authzforce** is a Policy Decision Point (PDP) Generic Enabler, which makes
authorization decisions based on `<PolicySet>` information written in
[XACML](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xacml). This
example starts with a running XACML server containing an existing set of rules.
An XACML server should offer an API to administrate policies and invoke access
control policy decisions. This tutorial is mainly concerned with the decision
making side - the creation and administration of access control policies will be
dealt with in a subsequent tutorial.

## Reading XACML Rulesets

A single XACML server can be used to administrate access control policies for
multiple applications. **Authzforce** is implicitly multi-tenant, in that it
allows separate organizations to work on their policies in isolation from one
another. This is done by separating the security policies for each application
into a separate **domain** where they can access their own `<PolicySets>`. A
domain holds meta data about the secured application along with versions of the
policies themselves (effectively a series of files which can be accessed by a
file server). The domain management API can be used to query **Authzforce**
about the domains served and policies held.

### List all domains

To request domain information from **Authzforce**, make a request to the
`/authzforce-ce/domains` endpoint.

#### 2 Request

```bash
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/authzforce-ce/domains
```

#### Response

The response lists the domains which are available in **Authzforce**. This
corresponds to the directory structure uploaded to **Authzforce** on start-up.

### Read a single domain

To read information about a domain, and to explore further, make a request to
the `authzforce-ce/domains/{{domain-id}}` endpoint. The following request
obtains information about the `gQqnLOnIEeiBFQJCrBIBDA` domain, which has been
generated using using a random key by an external Policy Adminstration Point in
this case **Keyrock** has been used as the PAP, and pre-generated the rule sets.

#### 3 Request

```bash
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/authzforce-ce/domains/gQqnLOnIEeiBFQJCrBIBDA
```

#### Response

The response lists more information about the domain, including the id used
within **Keyrock** (`tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp`)

## Requesting Policy Decisions

For the purpose of this tutorial, **Authzforce** has been just been supplied
with a simple set of basic role-based rules in a similar fashion to the level 2
authorization example found in the previous Securing Access tutorial:

-   The unlock door command can only be sent by **Security** staff.
-   Access to the price-change and order-stock areas are only available to
    **Managers**
-   People with either the **Manager** or **Security** role can ring the bell
-   Both **Manager** or **Security** can access and interact with the store data

The only difference is that access to all store entities is now restricted to
users with an assigned role rather than being based on level 1 authentication
access.

To request a decision from Authzforce, a structured request containing all
relevant information must be sent to the `domains/{domain-id}/pdp` endpoint. In
this case, the Body of the request includes information such as the roles that
the User has, the application id that is being requested
(`tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp`) and the HTTP verb and resource that are
being requested ( a GET request on the `/app/price-change` URL). Obviously the
information passed in the Body can be expanded as the rules become more complex.

### Permit Access to a Resource

To request a decision from Authzforce, make a POST requets to the
`domains/{domain-id}/pdp` endpoint. In this case the user has the
`managers-role-0000-0000-000000000000` and is requesting access the the
`/app/price-change` resource.

#### 7 Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/authzforce-ce/domains/gQqnLOnIEeiBFQJCrBIBDA/pdp \

```

#### Response

The `managers-role-0000-0000-000000000000` permits access to the
`/app/price-change` endpoint. The response for a successful request includes a
`<Decision>` element to `Permit` access to the resource.

```

### Deny Access to a Resource

To request a decision from Authzforce, make a POST requets to the
`domains/{domain-id}/pdp` endpoint. In this case the user has the
`security-role-0000-0000-000000000000` and is requesting access the the
`/app/price-change` resource.

# PDP - Advanced Authorization

As a reminder, there are three Levels of PDP Access Control:

-   Level 1: Authentication Access - Allow all actions to every signed in user
    and no actions to an anonymous user.
-   Level 2: Basic Authorization - Check which resources and verbs the currently
    logged in user should have access to
-   Level 3: Advanced Authorization - Fine grained control through
    [XACML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACML)

Within FIWARE, Level 3 access control can be provided by adding **Authzforce**
to the existing security microservices (IDM and PEP Proxy) within the Smart
Application infrastructure. Access control levels 1 and 2 have been covered in
[previous tutorials](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Securing-Access) and
can be fulfilled using **Keyrock** alone or with or without an associated PEP
Proxy.

## Advanced Authorization

Advanced Authorization is able to deal with complex rulesets. Permissions are no
longer merely based on a fixed role, resource and an action, but can be extended
as necessary.

For example users in role `XXX` can access URL **starting with** `YYY` provided
that the HTTP verb **is either** `GET`, `PUT` or `POST`. Such users may also
`DELETE` **provided that** they were the creator in the first place.

Within the tutorial programatic example we are using our own trusted instance of
**Keyrock** - once a user has signed in and obtained an `access_token`, the
`access_token` can be stored in session and used to retrieve user details on
demand. All access to the Orion context broker is hidden behind a PEP Proxy.
Whenever a request is made to Orion, the `access_token` is passed in the header
of the request, and the PEP proxy handles the decision to whether to execute the
request.

### User Obtains an Access Token

In order to identify themselves, every user must obtain an access token, in
order to do so, they must use one of the OAuth2 access grants described in a
[previous tutorial](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Securing-Access).

To log in using the user-credentials flow send a POST request to the
`oauth2/token` endpoint of **Keyrock** with the `grant_type=password`

#### 9 Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3005/oauth2/token \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dHV0b3JpYWwtZGNrci1zaXRlLTAwMDAteHByZXNzd2ViYXBwOnR1dG9yaWFsLWRja3Itc2l0ZS0wMDAwLWNsaWVudHNlY3JldA==' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'username=bob-the-manager@test.com&password=test&grant_type=password'
```

#### Response

The response returns an `access_token` to identify the user (in this case Bob
the Manager)

```json
{
    "access_token": "08fef363c429cb34cfff3f56dfe751a8d1890690",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "refresh_token": "35a644094b598cb0d720fcb323369a53820a6a44",
    "scope": ["bearer"]
}
```

### Obtain Roles and Domain

#### 10 Request

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:3005/user?access_token={{access_token}}&app_id={{app-id}}&authzforce=true'
```

Where :

-   `{{access-token}}` is the current access token of a logged in user (e.g.
    `08fef363c429cb34cfff3f56dfe751a8d1890690`)
-   `{{app-id}}` holds the application to request
    `tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp` and `authzforce=true` indicates that
    we want to obtain an **Authzforce** Domain from **Keyrock**

#### Response

The response include an `authorization_decision` attribute which denies direct
access for the request, but includes additional information so that an
additional request a decision from **Authzforce**

In the example below the access token used belonged to Bob the manager, and his
roles and the `app_azf_domain` associated to the `app-id` are returned.

```json
{
    "organizations": [],
    "displayName": "",
    "roles": [
        {
            "id": "managers-role-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "name": "Management"
        }
    ],
    "app_id": "tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp",
    "trusted_apps": [],
    "isGravatarEnabled": false,
    "email": "bob-the-manager@test.com",
    "id": "bbbbbbbb-good-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "authorization_decision": "",
    "app_azf_domain": "gQqnLOnIEeiBFQJCrBIBDA",
    "eidas_profile": {},
    "username": "bob"
}
```

### Apply a Policy to a Request

To request a decision from Authzforce, a structured request containing all
relevant information must be sent to the `domains/{domain-id}/pdp` endpoint. In
this case, the Body of the request includes information such as the roles that
the User has (`managers-role-0000-0000-000000000000`), the application id that
is being requested (`tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp`) and the HTTP verb
and resource that are being requested ( a POST request on the `/v2/entities`
URL)

    </ns3:Result>
</ns3:Response>
```

### Advanced Authorization - Sample Code

Programmatically, any Policy Execution Point consists of two parts, an oAuth
request to Keyrock retrieves information about the user (such as the assigned
roles) as well as the policy domain to be queried.

A second request is sent to the relevant domain endpoint within Authzforce,
providing all of the information necessary for Authzforce to provide a
judgement. Authzforce responds with a **permit** or **deny** response, and the
decision whether to continue can be made thereafter.

```javascript
function authorizeAdvancedXACML(req, res, next, resource = req.url) {
    const keyrockUserUrl =
        "http://keyrock/user?access_token=" +
        req.session.access_token +
        "&app_id=" +
        clientId +
        "&authzforce=true";

    return oa
        .get(keyrockUserUrl)
        .then(response => {
            const user = JSON.parse(response);
            return azf.policyDomainRequest(
                user.app_azf_domain,
                user.roles,
                resource,
                req.method
            );
        })
        .then(authzforceResponse => {
            res.locals.authorized = authzforceResponse === "Permit";
            return next();
        })
        .catch(error => {
            debug(error);
            res.locals.authorized = false;
            return next();
        });
}
```

The full code to supply each request to Authzforce can be found within the
tutorials'
[Git Repository](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Step-by-Step/blob/master/context-provider/lib/azf.js) -
the actual information to supply will depend on business use case - it could be
expanded to include temporal information, relationships between records and so
on, but in this very simple example only roles are necessary.

```javascript
const xml2js = require("xml2js");
const request = require("request");

function policyDomainRequest(domain, roles, resource, action) {
    let body =
        '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n' +
        '<Request xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17" CombinedDecision="false" ReturnPolicyIdList="false">\n';
    // Code to create the XML body for the request is omitted
    body = body + "</Request>";

    const options = {
        method: "POST",
        url: "http://authzforceUrl/authzforce-ce/domains/" + domain + "/pdp",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/xml" },
        body
    };

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        request(options, function(error, response, body) {
            let decision;
            xml2js.parseString(
                body,
                { tagNameProcessors: [xml2js.processors.stripPrefix] },
                function(err, jsonRes) {
                    // The decision is found within the /Response/Result[0]/Decision[0] XPath
                    decision = jsonRes.Response.Result[0].Decision[0];
                }
            );
            decision = String(decision);
            return error ? reject(error) : resolve(decision);
        });
    });
}
```

### Advanced Authorization - PEP Proxy

Applying advanced authorization within a PEP proxy requires very similar code to
the programmatic example described above. The **Wilma** generic enabler extracts
a token from the header supplied by the request and makes a request to
**Keyrock** to obtain further information about the user. A PDP request is then
made to **Authzforce** to decide whether to procede.

Obviously any scalable solution should also cache information about the PDP
requests made and the responses to avoid making unnecessary requests.

## PDP - Advanced Authorization - Running the Example

> **Note** Five resources have been secured at level 3:
>
> -   sending the unlock door command
> -   sending the ring bell command
> -   access to the price-change area
> -   access to the order-stock area
> -   access to Orion (behind a PEP Proxy)

#### Eve the Eavesdropper

Eve has an account, but no roles in the application.

-   From `http://localhost:3000`, log in as `eve@example.com` with the password
    `test`

##### Level 3 : Advanced Authorization Access

-   Click on any store page
    - access to view the page is **permitted** for any
    logged in users
    - access to retrieve Orion data is now **denied**
    since Eve has no role which permits access.

-   Click on the restricted access links at `http://localhost:3000` - access is
    **denied**
-   Open the Device Monitor on `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`
    -   Unlock a door - access is **denied**
    -   Ring a bell - access is **denied**


> **Note**: As Eve has a recognized account, she gains full **authentication**
> access (level 1).<br/>
> This means she is able to gain access to _view_ the store page on the application,
> even though her account has no roles attached.<br/>
> However, the PEP Proxy (secured at level 3) denies **authorization** access to _get_ the store data itself.

#### Bob The Regional Manager

Bob has the **management** role

-   From `http://localhost:3000`, log in as `bob-the-manager@test.com` with the
    password `test`

##### Level 3 : Advanced Authorization Access

-   Click on the restricted access links at `http://localhost:3000` - access is
    **permitted** - This is a management only permission
-   Open the Device Monitor on `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`
    -   Unlock a door - access is **denied**. - This is a security only
        permission
    -   Ring a bell - access is **permitted** - This is permitted to management
        users

#### Charlie the Security Manager

Charlie has the **security** role

-   From `http://localhost:3000`, log in as `charlie-security@test.com` with the
    password `test`

##### Level 3: Advanced Authorization Access

-   Click on the restricted access links at `http://localhost:3000` - access is
    **denied** - This is a management only permission
-   Open the Device Monitor on `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`
    -   Unlock a door - access is **permitted** - This is a security only
        permission
    -   Ring a bell - access is **permitted** - This is permitted to security
        users
