alternative generic enabler which is used to persist context data into third-party databases using
[Apache NIFI](https://nifi.apache.org) creating a historical view of the context. The in the same manner as the
[previous tutorial](historic-context-flume.md), activates the dummy IoT sensors persists measurements from those sensors
into a database for further analysis.

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as

# Data Persistence using Apache NIFI

> "Plots within plots, but all roads lead down the dragon’s gullet."
>
> — George R.R. Martin (A Dance With Dragons)

[FIWARE Draco](https://fiware-draco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an alternative generic enabler which is able to
persist historical context data to a series of databases. Like **Cygnus** - **Draco** is able subscribe to changes of
state from the **Orion Context Broker** and provide a funnel to process that data before persisting to a data sink.

As mentioned previously, persisting historical context data is useful for big data analysis or discovering trends or
removing outliers. Which tool you use to do this will depend on your needs, and unlike **Cygnus** **Draco** offers a
graphical interface to set up and monitor the procedure.

A summary of the differences can be seen below:

<h4>Device Monitor</h4>

For the purpose of this tutorial, a series of dummy IoT devices have been created, which will be attached to the context
broker. Details of the architecture and protocol used can be found in the [IoT Sensors tutorial](iot-sensors.md). The
state of each device can be seen on the UltraLight device monitor web page found at:
`http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

# Architecture

This application builds on the components and dummy IoT devices created in [previous tutorials](iot-agent.md). It will
make use of three FIWARE components - the [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the
[IoT Agent for Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and introduce the
[Draco Generic Enabler](https://fiware-draco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for persisting context data to a database.
Additional databases are now involved - both the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep persistence of the information they hold, and we will be
persisting our historical context data another database - either **MySQL** , **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** database.

Therefore the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   Three **FIWARE Generic Enablers**:
    -   The FIWARE [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests
        using [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
    -   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will
        receive northbound measurements from the dummy IoT devices in
        [Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
        format and convert them to [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) requests for the
        context broker to alter the state of the context entities
    -   FIWARE [Draco](https://fiware-draco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will subscribe to context changes and
        persist them into a database (**MySQL** , **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**)
-   One, two or three of the following **Databases**:
    -   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
        -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions
            and registrations
        -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys
        -   Potentially used as a data sink to hold historical context data.
    -   An additional [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database :
        -   Potentially used as a data sink to hold historical context data.
    -   An additional [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database :
        -   Potentially used as a data sink to hold historical context data.
-   Three **Context Providers**:
    -   The **Stock Management Frontend** is not used in this tutorial. It does the following:
        -   Display store information and allow users to interact with the dummy IoT devices
        -   Show which products can be bought at each store
        -   Allow users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.
    -   A webserver acting as set of [dummy IoT devices](iot-sensors.md) using the
        [Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
        protocol running over HTTP.
    -   The **Context Provider NGSI** proxy is not used in this tutorial. It does the following:
        -   receive requests using [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
        -   makes requests to publicly available data sources using their own APIs in a proprietary format
        -   returns context data back to the Orion Context Broker in
            [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) format.

Since all interactions between the services are initiated by HTTP requests, the services can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

The specific architecture of each section of the tutorial is discussed below.

# Start Up

Before you start you should ensure that you have obtained or built the necessary Docker images locally. Please clone the
repository and create the necessary images by running the commands as shown:

```console
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI.git
cd tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI

./services create
```

Thereafter, all services can be initialized from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/blob/master/services) Bash script provided within
the repository:

```console
./services <command>
```

Where `<command>` will vary depending upon the databases we wish to activate. This command will also import seed data
from the previous tutorials and provision the dummy IoT sensors on startup.

> :information_source: **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```console
> ./services stop
> ```

# MongoDB - Persisting Context Data into a Database

Persisting historic context data using MongoDB technology is relatively simple to configure since we are already using a
MongoDB instance to hold data related to the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent. The MongoDB instance is listening
on the standard `27017` port and the overall architecture can be seen below:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/mongo-draco-tutorial.png)

<h3>MongoDB - Database Server Configuration</h3>

```yaml
mongo-db:
    image: mongo:3.6
    hostname: mongo-db
    container_name: db-mongo
    ports:
        - "27017:27017"
    networks:
        - default
    command: --bind_ip_all --smallfiles
```

<h3>MongoDB - Draco Configuration</h3>

```yaml
draco:
    image: ging/fiware-draco:1.1.0
    container_name: draco
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    environment:
        - NIFI_WEB_HTTP_PORT=9090
    ports:
        - "9090:9090"
        - "5050:5050"
    healthcheck:
        test: curl --fail -s http://localhost:9090/nifi-api/system-diagnostics || exit 1
```

The `draco` container is listening on two ports:

-   The Subscription Port for Draco - `5050` is where the service will be listening for notifications from the Orion
    context broker
-   The Web interface for Draco - `9090` is exposed purely for configuring the processors

## MongoDB - Start up

To start the system with a **MongoDB** database only, run the following command:

```console
./services mongodb
```

Then go to your browser and open Draco using this URL `http://localhost:9090/nifi`

Now go to the Components toolbar which is placed in the upper section of the NiFi GUI, find the template icon and drag
and drop it inside the Draco user space. At this point, a popup should be displayed with a list of all the templates
available. Please select the template MONGO-TUTORIAL.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/mongo-tutorial-template.png)

Select all the processors (press shift and click on every processor) and start them by clicking on the start button.
Now, you can see that the status icon of each processor turned from red to green.

### Checking the Draco Service Health

Once Draco is running, you can check the status by making an HTTP request to the exposed draco port to
`/nifi-api/system-diagnostics`. If the response is blank, this is usually because Draco is not running or is listening
on another port.

#### 1 Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:9090/nifi-api/system-diagnostics'
```

#### Response:

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "systemDiagnostics": {
        "aggregateSnapshot": {
            "totalNonHeap": "value",
            "totalNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "usedNonHeap": "value",
            "usedNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "freeNonHeap": "value",
            "freeNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "maxNonHeap": "value",
            "maxNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "nonHeapUtilization": "value",
            "totalHeap": "value",
            "totalHeapBytes": 0,
            "usedHeap": "value",
            "usedHeapBytes": 0,
            "freeHeap": "value",
            "freeHeapBytes": 0,
            "maxHeap": "value",
            "maxHeapBytes": 0,
            "heapUtilization": "value",
            "availableProcessors": 0,
            "processorLoadAverage": 0.0,
            "totalThreads": 0,
            "daemonThreads": 0,
            "uptime": "value",
            "flowFileRepositoryStorageUsage": {},
            "contentRepositoryStorageUsage": [{}],
            "provenanceRepositoryStorageUsage": [{}],
            "garbageCollection": [{}],
            "statsLastRefreshed": "value",
            "versionInfo": {}
        },
        "nodeSnapshots": [{}]
    }
}
```

> **Troubleshooting:** What if the response is blank ?
>
> -   To check that a docker container is running try
>
> ```bash
> docker ps
> ```
>
> You should see several containers running. If `draco` is not running, you can restart the containers as necessary.

### Generating Context Data

For the purpose of this tutorial, we must be monitoring a system where the context is periodically being updated. The
dummy IoT Sensors can be used to do this. Open the device monitor page at `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor` and
unlock a **Smart Door** and switch on a **Smart Lamp**. This can be done by selecting an appropriate the command from
the drop down list and pressing the `send` button. The stream of measurements coming from the devices can then be seen
on the same page:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/door-open.gif)

### Subscribing to Context Changes

Once a dynamic context system is up and running, we need to inform **Draco** of changes in context.

This is done by making a POST request to the `/v2/subscription` endpoint of the Orion Context Broker.

-   The `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers are used to filter the subscription to only listen to
    measurements from the attached IoT Sensors, since they had been provisioned using these settings
-   The `idPattern` in the request body ensures that Draco will be informed of all context data changes.
-   The notification `url` must match the configured `Base Path and Listening port` of the Draco Listen HTTP Processor
-   The `throttling` value defines the rate that changes are sampled.

#### 2 Request:

```console
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "description": "Notify Draco of all context changes",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "idPattern": ".*"
      }
    ]
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://draco:5050/v2/notify"
    }
  },
  "throttling": 5
}'
```

As you can see, the database used to persist context data has no impact on the details of the subscription. It is the
same for each database. The response will be **201 - Created**

If a subscription has been created, you can check to see if it is firing by making a GET request to the
`/v2/subscriptions` endpoint.

#### 3 Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "5b39d7c866df40ed84284174",
        "description": "Notify Draco of all context changes",
        "status": "active",
        "subject": {
            "entities": [
                {
                    "idPattern": ".*"
                }
            ],
            "condition": {
                "attrs": []
            }
        },
        "notification": {
            "timesSent": 158,
            "lastNotification": "2018-07-02T07:59:21.00Z",
            "attrs": [],
            "http": {
                "url": "http://draco:5050/v2/notify"
            },
            "lastSuccess": "2018-07-02T07:59:21.00Z"
        },
        "throttling": 5
    }
]
```

Within the `notification` section of the response, you can see several additional `attributes` which describe the health
of the subscription

If the criteria of the subscription have been met, `timesSent` should be greater than `0`. A zero value would indicate
that the `subject` of the subscription is incorrect or the subscription has created with the wrong `fiware-service-path`
or `fiware-service` header

The `lastNotification` should be a recent timestamp - if this is not the case, then the devices are not regularly
sending data. Remember to unlock the **Smart Door** and switch on the **Smart Lamp**

The `lastSuccess` should match the `lastNotification` date - if this is not the case then **Draco** is not receiving the
subscription properly. Check that the hostname and port are correct.

Finally, check that the `status` of the subscription is `active` - an expired subscription will not fire.

## MongoDB - Reading Data from a database

To read MongoDB data from the command-line, we will need access to the `mongo` tool run an interactive instance of the
`mongo` image as shown to obtain a command-line prompt:

```console
docker run -it --network fiware_default  --entrypoint /bin/bash mongo
```

You can then log into to the running `mongo-db` database by using the command-line as shown:

```bash
mongo --host mongo-db
```

### Show Available Databases on the MongoDB server

To show the list of available databases, run the statement as shown:

#### Query:

```
show dbs
```

#### Result:

```
admin          0.000GB
iotagentul     0.000GB
local          0.000GB
orion          0.000GB
orion-openiot  0.000GB
sth_openiot    0.000GB
```

The result include two databases `admin` and `local` which are set up by default by **MongoDB**, along with four
databases created by the FIWARE platform. The Orion Context Broker has created two separate database instance for each
`fiware-service`

-   The Store entities were created without defining a `fiware-service` and therefore are held within the `orion`
    database, whereas the IoT device entities were created using the `openiot` `fiware-service` header and are held
    separately. The IoT Agent was initialized to hold the IoT sensor data in a separate **MongoDB** database called
    `iotagentul`.

As a result of the subscription of Draco to Orion Context Broker, a new database has been created called `sth_openiot`.
The default value for a **Mongo DB** database holding historic context consists of the `sth_` prefix followed by the
`fiware-service` header - therefore `sth_openiot` holds the historic context of the IoT devices.

### Read Historical Context from the server

#### Query:

```
use sth_openiot
show collections
```

#### Result:

```
switched to db sth_openiot

sth_/_Door:001_Door
sth_/_Door:001_Door.aggr
sth_/_Lamp:001_Lamp
sth_/_Lamp:001_Lamp.aggr
sth_/_Motion:001_Motion
sth_/_Motion:001_Motion.aggr
```

Looking within the `sth_openiot` you will see that a series of tables have been created. The names of each table consist
of the `sth_` prefix followed by the `fiware-servicepath` header followed by the entity ID. Two table are created for
each entity - the `.aggr` table holds some aggregated data which will be accessed in a later tutorial. The raw data can
be seen in the tables without the `.aggr` suffix.

The historical data can be seen by looking at the data within each table, by default each row will contain the sampled
value of a single attribute.

#### Query:

```
db["sth_/_Door:001_Door"].find().limit(10)
```

#### Result:

```
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b1fa48630c49e0012f7635d"), "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:46:30.897Z"), "attrName" : "TimeInstant", "attrType" : "ISO8601", "attrValue" : "2018-06-12T10:46:30.836Z" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b1fa48630c49e0012f7635e"), "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:46:30.897Z"), "attrName" : "close_status", "attrType" : "commandStatus", "attrValue" : "UNKNOWN" }

{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b1fa48630c49e0012f76360"), "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:46:30.897Z"), "attrName" : "open_status", "attrType" : "commandStatus", "attrValue" : "UNKNOWN" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b1fa48630c49e0012f76361"), "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:46:30.836Z"), "attrName" : "refStore", "attrType" : "Relationship", "attrValue" : "Store:001" }

{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b1fa48630c49e0012f76363"), "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:45:26.368Z"), "attrName" : "unlock_info", "attrType" : "commandResult", "attrValue" : " unlock OK" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b1fa48630c49e0012f76364"), "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:45:26.368Z"), "attrName" : "unlock_status", "attrType" : "commandStatus", "attrValue" : "OK" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b1fa4c030c49e0012f76385"), "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:47:28.081Z"), "attrName" : "TimeInstant", "attrType" : "ISO8601", "attrValue" : "2018-06-12T10:47:28.038Z" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b1fa4c030c49e0012f76386"), "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:47:28.081Z"), "attrName" : "close_status", "attrType" : "commandStatus", "attrValue" : "UNKNOWN" }
```

The usual **MongoDB** query syntax can be used to filter appropriate fields and values. For example to read the rate at
which the **Motion Sensor** with the `id=Motion:001_Motion` is accumulating, you would make a query as follows:

#### Query:

```
db["sth_/_Motion:001_Motion"].find({attrName: "count"},{_id: 0, attrType: 0, attrName: 0 } ).limit(10)
```

#### Result:

```
{ "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:46:18.756Z"), "attrValue" : "8" }
{ "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:46:36.881Z"), "attrValue" : "10" }
{ "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:46:42.947Z"), "attrValue" : "11" }
{ "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:46:54.893Z"), "attrValue" : "13" }
{ "recvTime" : ISODate("2018-06-12T10:47:00.929Z"), "attrValue" : "15" }

# PostgreSQL - Persisting Context Data into a Database

To persist historic context data into an alternative database such as **PostgreSQL**, we will need an additional
container which hosts the PostgreSQL server - the default Docker image for this data can be used. The PostgreSQL
instance is listening on the standard `5432` port and the overall architecture can be seen below:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/postgres-draco-tutorial.png)

We now have a system with two databases, since the MongoDB container is still required to hold data related to the Orion
Context Broker and the IoT Agent.

<h3>PostgreSQL - Database Server Configuration</h3>

```yaml
postgres-db:
    image: postgres:latest
    hostname: postgres-db
    container_name: db-postgres
    expose:
        - "5432"
    ports:
        - "5432:5432"
    networks:
        - default
    environment:
        - "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password"
        - "POSTGRES_USER=postgres"
        - "POSTGRES_DB=postgres"
```

The `postgres-db` container is listening on a single port:

-   Port `5432` is the default port for a PostgreSQL server. It has been exposed so you can also run the `pgAdmin4` tool
    to display database data if you wish

The `postgres-db` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key               | Value.     | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| POSTGRES_PASSWORD | `password` | Password for the PostgreSQL database user |
| POSTGRES_USER     | `postgres` | Username for the PostgreSQL database user |
| POSTGRES_DB       | `postgres` | The name of the PostgreSQL database       |

> :information_source: **Note:** Passing the Username and Password in plain text environment variables like this is a
> security risk. Whereas this is acceptable practice in a tutorial, for a production environment, you can avoid this
> risk by applying [Docker Secrets](https://blog.docker.com/2017/02/docker-secrets-management/)

<h3>PostgreSQL - Draco Configuration</h3>

```yaml
draco:
    image: ging/fiware-draco:1.1.0
    container_name: draco
    depends_on:
        - postgres-db
    environment:
        - NIFI_WEB_HTTP_PORT=9090
    ports:
        - "9090:9090"
        - "5050:5050"
    healthcheck:
        test: curl --fail -s http://localhost:9090/nifi-api/system-diagnostics || exit 1
```

The `draco` container is listening on two ports:

-   The Subscription Port for Draco - `5050` is where the service will be listening for notifications from the Orion
    context broker
-   The Web interface for Draco - `9090` is exposed purely for configuring the processors.

## PostgreSQL - Start up

To start the system with a **PostgreSQL** database run the following command:

```console
./services postgres
```

Then go to your browser and open Draco using this URL `http://localhost:9090/nifi`

Now go to the Components toolbar which is placed in the upper section of the NiFi GUI, find the template icon and drag
and drop it inside the Draco user space. At this point, a popup should be displayed with a list of all the templates
available. Please select the template POSTGRESQL-TUTORIAL.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/postgres-tutorial-template.png)

Before starting the processors, you need to set your PostgreSQL password and enable the DBCConnectionPool controller.
For doing that please follow the instructions:

1.  Do right click on any part of the Draco GUI user space, and then click on configure.
    ![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/step1.png)

2.  Go to the Controller Services Tab, at this point a list of controllers should be displayed, locate the
    DBCConnectionPool controller.

3.  Click on the configuration button of the "DBCPConnectionPool"
    ![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/step2.png)

4.  Go to the controller Properties tab and put "password" in the password field, then apply the changes.
    ![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/controller-postgresql.png)

5.  Enable the processor by clicking on the thunder icon and then click on enable, then close the controller
    configuration page.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/step4.png)

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/step5.png)

6.  Select all the processors (press shift and click on every processor) and start them by clicking on the start button.
    Now, you can see that the status icon of each processor turned from red to green.

### Checking the Draco Service Health

Once Draco is running, you can check the status by making an HTTP request to the exposed draco port to
`/nifi-api/system-diagnostics`. If the response is blank, this is usually because Draco is not running or is listening
on another port.

#### 4 Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:9090/nifi-api/system-diagnostics'
```

#### Response:

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "systemDiagnostics": {
        "aggregateSnapshot": {
            "totalNonHeap": "value",
            "totalNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "usedNonHeap": "value",
            "usedNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "freeNonHeap": "value",
            "freeNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "maxNonHeap": "value",
            "maxNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "nonHeapUtilization": "value",
            "totalHeap": "value",
            "totalHeapBytes": 0,
            "usedHeap": "value",
            "usedHeapBytes": 0,
            "freeHeap": "value",
            "freeHeapBytes": 0,
            "maxHeap": "value",
            "maxHeapBytes": 0,
            "heapUtilization": "value",
            "availableProcessors": 0,
            "processorLoadAverage": 0.0,
            "totalThreads": 0,
            "daemonThreads": 0,
            "uptime": "value",
            "flowFileRepositoryStorageUsage": {},
            "contentRepositoryStorageUsage": [{}],

            "versionInfo": {}
        },
        "nodeSnapshots": [{}]
    }
}
```

> **Troubleshooting:** What if the response is blank ?

### Generating Context Data

For the purpose of this tutorial, we must be monitoring a system where the context is periodically being updated. The
dummy IoT Sensors can be used to do this. Open the device monitor page at `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor` and
unlock a **Smart Door** and switch on a **Smart Lamp**. This can be done by selecting an appropriate the command from
the drop down list and pressing the `send` button. The stream of measurements coming from the devices can then be seen
on the same page:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/door-open.gif)

### Subscribing to Context Changes

Once a dynamic context system is up and running, we need to inform **Draco** of changes in context.

This is done by making a POST request to the `/v2/subscription` endpoint of the Orion Context Broker.

-   The `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers are used to filter the subscription to only listen to
    measurements from the attached IoT Sensors, since they had been provisioned using these settings
-   The `idPattern` in the request body ensures that Draco will be informed of all context data changes.
-   The `throttling` value defines the rate that changes are sampled.

#### 5 Request:

```console
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "description": "Notify Draco of all context changes",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "idPattern": ".*"
      }
    ]
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://draco:5050/v2/notify"
    }
  },
  "throttling": 5
}'
```

As you can see, the database used to persist context data has no impact on the details of the subscription. It is the
same for each database. The response will be **201 - Created**

## PostgreSQL - Reading Data from a database

To read PostgreSQL data from the command-line, we will need access to the `postgres` client, to do this, run an
interactive instance of the `postgresql-client` image supplying the connection string as shown to obtain a command-line
prompt:

```console
docker run -it --rm  --network fiware_default jbergknoff/postgresql-client \
   postgresql://postgres:password@postgres-db:5432/postgres
```

### Show Available Databases on the PostgreSQL server

To show the list of available databases, run the statement as shown:

#### Query:

```
\list
```

#### Result:

```
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges
-----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 |
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
(3 rows)
```

The result include two template databases `template0` and `template1` as well as the `postgres` database setup when the
docker container was started.

To show the list of available schemas, run the statement as shown:

#### Query:

```
\dn
```

#### Result:

```
  List of schemas
  Name   |  Owner
---------+----------
 openiot | postgres
 public  | postgres
(2 rows)
```

As a result of the subscription of Draco to Orion Context Broker, a new schema has been created called `openiot`. The
name of the schema matches the `fiware-service` header - therefore `openiot` holds the historic context of the IoT
devices.

### Read Historical Context from the PostgreSQL server

Once running a docker container within the network, it is possible to obtain information about the running database.

#### Query:

```sql
SELECT table_schema,table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema ='openiot'
ORDER BY table_schema,table_name;
```

#### Result:

```
 table_schema |    table_name
--------------+-------------------
 openiot      | door_001_door
 openiot      | lamp_001_lamp
 openiot      | motion_001_motion
(3 rows)
```

The `table_schema` matches the `fiware-service` header supplied with the context data:

To read the data within a table, run a select statement as shown:

#### Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM openiot.motion_001_motion limit 10;
```

#### Result:

```
  recvtimets   |         recvtime         | fiwareservicepath |  entityid  | entitytype |  attrname   |   attrtype   |        attrvalue         |                                    attrmd

 1528803047545 | 2018-06-12T11:30:47.545Z | /
```

The usual **PostgreSQL** query syntax can be used to filter appropriate fields and values. For example to read the rate
at which the **Motion Sensor** with the `id=Motion:001_Motion` is accumulating, you would make a query as follows:

#### Query:

```sql
SELECT recvtime, attrvalue FROM openiot.motion_001_motion WHERE attrname ='count'  limit 10;
```

#### Result:

```
         recvtime         | attrvalue
--------------------------+-----------
 2018-06-12T11:30:05.491Z | 7
 2018-06-12T11:30:35.501Z | 10
 2018-06-12T11:30:41.563Z | 12
 2018-06-12T11:30:47.545Z | 13
 2018-06-12T11:31:02.617Z | 15
 2018-06-12T11:31:32.718Z | 20
 2018-06-12T11:31:38.733Z | 22
 2018-06-12T11:31:50.780Z | 24
 2018-06-12T11:31:56.825Z | 25
 2018-06-12T11:31:59.790Z | 26
(10 rows)
```

To leave the Postgres client and leave interactive mode, run the following:

```console
\q
```

You will then return to the command-line.

# MySQL - Persisting Context Data into a Database

Similarly, to persisting historic context data into **MySQL**, we will again need an additional container which hosts
the MySQL server, once again the default Docker image for this data can be used. The MySQL instance is listening on the
standard `3306` port and the overall architecture can be seen below:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/mysql-draco-tutorial.png)

Once again we have a system with two databases, since the MongoDB container is still required to hold data related to
the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent.

<h3>MySQL - Database Server Configuration</h3>

```yaml
mysql-db:
    restart: always
    image: mysql:5.7
    hostname: mysql-db
    container_name: db-mysql
    expose:
        - "3306"
    ports:
        - "3306:3306"
    networks:
        - default
    environment:
        - "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123"
        - "MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=%"
```

> :information_source: **Note:** Using the default `root` user and displaying the password in an environment variables

The `mysql-db` container is listening on a single port:

-   Port `3306` is the default port for a MySQL server. It has been exposed so you can also run other database tools to
    display data if you wish

The `mysql-db` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                 | Value.     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD | `123`.     | specifies a password that is set for the MySQL `root` account.                                                                                                                                        |
| MYSQL_ROOT_HOST     | `%` | By default, MySQL creates the `root'@'localhost` account. This account can only be connected to from inside the container. Setting this environment variable allows root connections from other hosts |

<h3>MySQL - Draco Configuration</h3>

```yaml
draco:
    image: ging/fiware-draco:1.1.0
    container_name: draco
    depends_on:
        - mysql-db
    environment:
        - NIFI_WEB_HTTP_PORT=9090
    ports:
        - "9090:9090"
        - "5050:5050"
    healthcheck:
        test: curl --fail -s http://localhost:9090/nifi-api/system-diagnostics || exit 1
```

The `draco` container is listening on two ports:

-   The Subscription Port for Draco - `5050` is where the service will be listening for notifications from the Orion
    context broker
-   The Web interface for Draco - `9090` is exposed purely for configuring the processors

## MySQL - Start up

To start the system with a **MySQL** database run the following command:

```console
./services mysql

6.  Select all the processors (press shift and click on every processor) and start them by clicking on the start button.
    Now, you can see that the status icon of each processor turned from red to green.

### Checking the Draco Service Health

Once Draco is running, you can check the status by making an HTTP request to the exposed draco port to
`/system-diagnostics`. If the response is blank, this is usually because Draco is not running or is listening on another
port.

#### 6 Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:9090/system-diagnostics'
```

#### Response:

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "systemDiagnostics": {
        "aggregateSnapshot": {
            "totalNonHeap": "value",
            "totalNonHeapBytes": 0,

### Generating Context Data

For the purpose of this tutorial, we must be monitoring a system where the context is periodically being updated. The
dummy IoT Sensors can be used to do this. Open the device monitor page at `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor` and
unlock a **Smart Door** and switch on a **Smart Lamp**. This can be done by selecting an appropriate the command from
the drop down list and pressing the `send` button. The stream of measurements coming from the devices can then be seen
on the same page:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/door-open.gif)

### Subscribing to Context Changes

Once a dynamic context system is up and running, we need to inform **Draco** of changes in context.

This is done by making a POST request to the `/v2/subscription` endpoint of the Orion Context Broker.

-   The `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers are used to filter the subscription to only listen to
    measurements from the attached IoT Sensors, since they had been provisioned using these settings
-   The `idPattern` in the request body ensures that Draco will be informed of all context data changes.
-   The `throttling` value defines the rate that changes are sampled.

#### 7 Request:

```console
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "description": "Notify Draco of all context changes",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "idPattern": ".*"
      }
    ]
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://draco:5050/v2/notify"
    }
  },
  "throttling": 5
}'
```

As you can see, the database used to persist context data has no impact on the details of the subscription. It is the
same for each database. The response will be **201 - Created**

## MySQL - Reading Data from a database

To read MySQL data from the command-line, we will need access to the `mysql` client, to do this, run an interactive
instance of the `mysql` image supplying the connection string as shown to obtain a command-line prompt:

```console
docker exec -it  db-mysql mysql -h mysql-db -P 3306  -u root -p123
```

### Show Available Databases on the MySQL server

To show the list of available databases, run the statement as shown:

#### Query:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

#### Result:

```
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| openiot            |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

To show the list of available schemas, run the statement as shown:

#### Query:

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS;
```

#### Result:

```
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| openiot            |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

As a result of the subscription of Draco to Orion Context Broker, a new schema has been created called `openiot`. The
name of the schema matches the `fiware-service` header - therefore `openiot` holds the historic context of the IoT
devices.

### Read Historical Context from the MySQL server

Once running a docker container within the network, it is possible to obtain information about the running database.

#### Query:

```sql
SHOW tables FROM openiot;
```

#### Result:

```
 table_schema |    table_name
--------------+-------------------
 openiot      | door_001_door
 openiot      | lamp_001_lamp
 openiot      | motion_001_motion
(3 rows)
```

The `table_schema` matches the `fiware-service` header supplied with the context data:

To read the data within a table, run a select statement as shown:

#### Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM openiot.Motion_001_Motion limit 10;
```

#### Result:

```

The usual **MySQL** query syntax can be used to filter appropriate fields and values. For example to read the rate at
which the **Motion Sensor** with the `id=Motion:001_Motion` is accumulating, you would make a query as follows:

#### Query:

```sql
SELECT recvtime, attrvalue FROM openiot.Motion_001_Motion WHERE attrname ='count' LIMIT 10;
```

#### Result:

```
+-------------------------+-----------+

| 2018-06-12T11:55:30.350 | 25        |
+-------------------------+-----------+
10 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

To leave the MySQL client and leave interactive mode, run the following:

```console
\q
```

You will then return to the command-line.

# Multi-Agent - Persisting Context Data into a multiple Databases

It is also possible to configure Draco to populate multiple databases simultaneously. We can combine the architecture
from the three previous examples and configure Draco to store data in multiple sinks.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/multiple-draco-tutorial.png)

We now have a system with three databases, PostgreSQL and MySQL for data persistence and MongoDB for both data
persistence and holding data related to the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent.

<h3>Multi-Agent - Draco Configuration for Multiple Databases</h3>

```yaml
draco:
    image: ging/fiware-draco:1.1.0
    container_name: draco
    depends_on:
        - mysql-db
        - mongo-db
        - postgres-db
    environment:
        - NIFI_WEB_HTTP_PORT=9090
    ports:
        - "9090:9090"
        - "5050:5050"
    healthcheck:
        test: curl --fail -s http://localhost:9090/nifi-api/system-diagnostics || exit 1
```

The `draco` container is listening on two ports:

-   The Subscription Port for Draco - `5050` is where the service will be listening for notifications from the Orion
    context broker
-   The Web interface for Draco - `9090` is exposed purely for configuring the processors

## Multi-Agent - Start up

To start the system with **multiple** databases run the following command:

```console
./services multiple
```

Then go to your browser and open Draco using this URL `http://localhost:9090/nifi`

Now go to the Components toolbar which is placed in the upper section of the NiFi GUI, find the template icon and drag
and drop it inside the Draco user space. At this point, a popup should be displayed with a list of all the templates
available. Please select the template MULTIPLE-SINKS-TUTORIAL.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context-NIFI/img/multiple-tutorial-template.png)

Now repeat the process for setting the password in the controller "DBCPConnectionPool" each connection MySQL and
PostgreSQL

Select all the processors (press shift and click on every processor) and start them by clicking on the start button.
Now, you can see that the status icon of each processor turned from red to green.

### Checking the Draco Service Health

Once Draco is running, you can check the status by making an HTTP request to the exposed draco port to
`/system-diagnostics`. If the response is blank, this is usually because Draco is not running or is listening on another
port.

#### 8 Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:9090/nifi-api/system-diagnostics'
```

#### Response:

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "systemDiagnostics": {
        "aggregateSnapshot": {
            "totalNonHeap": "value",
            "totalNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "usedNonHeap": "value",
            "usedNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "freeNonHeap": "value",
            "freeNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "maxNonHeap": "value",
            "maxNonHeapBytes": 0,
            "nonHeapUtilization": "value",
            "totalHeap": "value",
            "totalHeapBytes": 0,
            "usedHeap": "value",
            "usedHeapBytes": 0,
            "freeHeap": "value",
            "freeHeapBytes": 0,
            "maxHeap": "value",
            "maxHeapBytes": 0,
            "heapUtilization": "value",
            "availableProcessors": 0,
            "processorLoadAverage": 0.0,
            "totalThreads": 0,
            "daemonThreads": 0,
            "uptime": "value",
            "flowFileRepositoryStorageUsage": {},
            "contentRepositoryStorageUsage": [{}],
            "provenanceRepositoryStorageUsage": [{}],
            "garbageCollection": [{}],
            "statsLastRefreshed": "value",
            "versionInfo": {}
        },
        "nodeSnapshots": [{}]
    }
}
```

## Multi-Agent - Reading Persisted Data

To read persisted data from the attached databases, please refer to the previous sections of this tutorial.
